# Flacko Trading System - Quick Reference

## Core Philosophy

We are **swing traders** building 3-6-9 month positions. Pullbacks are opportunities to accumulate at better prices, not threats. The question isn't "should I buy?" but "how much at these levels?"

## The 4-Mode Traffic Light System

| Mode | Meaning | Daily Cap | Posture |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | Uptrend intact, momentum healthy | 25-35% | Buy dips normally |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | Warning signs, trend weakening | 15-20% | Controlled accumulation at key levels |
| 🟠 **ORANGE** | Multiple warnings, structure weakening | 10% | Small nibbles only at key support |
| 🔴 **RED** | Trend broken, confirmed downtrend | 5% | Nibbles at extreme support only, Master Eject active |

**Key Principle:** As conditions worsen → reduce size, require better prices.

## The 4-Tier Timeframe System

| Tier | Name | Timeframe | Purpose | Color Meaning |
|------|------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | Long | Weekly | Defines the game | 🟢 = healthy trend |
| **Tier 2** | Medium | Daily | Confirming or diverging? | 🟢 = healthy trend |
| **Tier 3** | Short | 4H | Good entry moment? | 🟢 = good entry setup |
| **Tier 4** | Hourly | 1H | At a buy zone? | 🟢 = at pullback zone |

**Key Insight:**
- Tier 1-2 colors = **trend health** (green = bullish)
- Tier 3-4 colors = **entry quality** (green = oversold/pullback = good entry)
- Tier 1 + Tier 2 determine MODE
- Tier 3 + Tier 4 refine ENTRY TIMING

---

## Critical Levels

### Slow Zone (Daily 21 EMA)
When price closes below Daily 21 EMA → **stop all new buys** until bounce confirms reclaim.

### Master Eject
Pre-defined exit level (lower of Weekly 21 EMA or Put Wall). Daily close below = exit all. No exceptions. No hoping.

### SpotGamma Levels
- **Call Wall** — Upside resistance, trim zone
- **Key Gamma Strike** — Above = stable, Below = volatile
- **Hedge Wall** — Pivot level
- **Put Wall** — Support floor, break = acceleration lower

---

## Position Sizing

**Daily Cap by Mode:**
- GREEN: 25-35% of available cash
- YELLOW: 15-20%
- ORANGE: 10%
- RED: 5%

**Bullet Size:** Daily cap ÷ 4 = per-trade size

**Example:** $100K cash, YELLOW mode (20% cap) = $20K daily budget = $5K per bullet

---

## Key Rules

1. **Mode determines sizing** — The system caps you, preventing over-commitment
2. **Worse conditions = better prices required** — Demand deeper discounts as risk rises
3. **Levels do the work** — Set alerts, walk away, let prices come to you
4. **No blind averaging down** — Controlled accumulation at KEY levels only
5. **Slow Zone is sacred** — Below Daily 21 EMA = no new buys until reclaim
6. **Master Eject is non-negotiable** — Daily close below = out, no exceptions

## Indicator Quick Reference

### BX-Trender
Four distinct states based on structure:
- **Light Green (HH)** = Strong bullish - making higher highs
- **Dark Green (LH)** = Weakening bullish - no longer making new highs (warning)
- **Light Red (HL)** = Weakening bearish - potential upside turnaround
- **Dark Red (LL)** = Strong bearish - making lower lows

**Key insight:** The signal is in the TRANSITION. Dark Red → Light Red is bullish. Light Green → Dark Green is a warning.

### SMI (Stochastic Momentum Index)
- Oversold (<-40) = bounce potential
- Overbought (>+40) = pullback risk
- Bullish cross = momentum turning up
- Bearish cross = momentum turning down

### Weekly EMAs (9/13/21)
- 9 EMA = Momentum
- 13 EMA = Control
- 21 EMA = Structure (last line of defense)
- Above all with 9>13>21 = healthy trend

---

## Mode Change Triggers

**To Upgrade (toward GREEN):**
- Weekly BX-Trender shifts to Light Green (HH) - or Dark Red → Light Red (HL) as early signal
- Price reclaims key EMAs
- Structure holds (higher low confirmed)

**To Downgrade (toward RED):**
- Weekly BX-Trender shifts to Dark Red (LL) - or Light Green → Dark Green (LH) as early warning
- Price loses key EMAs
- Structure breaks (lower low confirmed)

---

## The Goal

**Participate in the upside. Survive the corrections. Build wealth over time.**

This system protects you by:
1. Providing early warning (Tier 1/2 divergence warns 1-2 weeks ahead)
2. Sizing appropriately (mode caps prevent over-commitment)
3. Identifying logical levels (where institutions act)
4. Enforcing discipline (Slow Zone + Master Eject)
