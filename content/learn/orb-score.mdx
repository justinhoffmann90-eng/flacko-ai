## One Number. Four Zones. Every Trading Day.

The Orb Score analyzes TSLA across multiple dimensions -- momentum, trend strength, volatility, and institutional positioning -- and distills it into a single daily reading.

Based on 1,005 trading days of validated data, each zone has a distinct statistical profile that tells you exactly how to position.

---

## 🟢 FULL SEND

**Frequency:** ~15% of trading days

**What it means:** Multiple bullish signals are firing simultaneously and nothing is warning. Momentum, trend structure, and positioning are all aligned in the same direction. These are the strongest conditions TSLA produces.

**The stats:**
- Average 20-day forward return: **+6.22%**
- Win rate (positive 20 days later): **66%**
- Top 10% of outcomes: **+30%+ at 20 days**
- 60-day average: **+16.28%**

**What to do:** This is when you deploy leveraged positions -- calls, TSLL, whatever your vehicle is. The data says conditions like these produce outsized returns two-thirds of the time, and the best cases are explosive. Size with conviction.

**What ends it:** When buy signals deactivate and the score drops to NEUTRAL, don't panic. The data shows FULL SEND -> NEUTRAL transitions still average +5.96% over 20 days (62% win rate) and +14.05% at 60 days. The rally doesn't end the moment the score changes -- it just means conditions are no longer exceptional. Hold positions, don't sell into the downgrade.

## ⚪ NEUTRAL

**Frequency:** ~51% of trading days

**What it means:** Normal TSLA. No strong signals in either direction. The trend may be intact but there's nothing compelling enough to justify adding risk or reducing it. This is the market's default state.

**The stats:**
- Average 20-day forward return: **+4.22%**
- Win rate: **52%**
- 60-day average: **+10.44%**

**What to do:** Hold existing positions. Don't add new leveraged exposure, but don't trim either. This is "steady as she goes" -- the long-term TSLA drift is working in your favor, but it's not the time to press.

**What to watch for:** NEUTRAL -> FULL SEND transitions average +5.69% at 20 days and +13.16% at 60 days -- that's your signal to start deploying. NEUTRAL -> CAUTION transitions show damage starting at 10 days (-0.57%, only 43% win rate) -- that's your signal to start tightening. The deterioration is fast, so act on the 10-day signal rather than waiting for 20.

## 🟡 CAUTION

**Frequency:** ~24% of trading days

**What it means:** Warning signals are active. The trend is showing stress -- the kind of deterioration that historically leads to below-average or negative outcomes over the next few weeks. Something in the structure is breaking.

**The stats:**
- Average 20-day forward return: **-1.24%**
- Win rate: **41%**
- Combined with DEFENSIVE, bottom zones average: **-2.15% at 20d**

**What to do:** Take profits on leveraged positions. Do not open new calls or add to TSLL. If you're holding 3-6 month calls with time value, you can hold through -- but tighten your mental stops. If you're holding short-dated options or 2x ETF, this is your cue to reduce.

**Why it matters for leverage:** A -1.24% average on TSLA stock translates to roughly -2.5% to -4% on a 2x ETF and potentially much worse on near-term options depending on strike and expiry. The negative expected value is amplified by leverage -- which is exactly why you want to be light here.

**What to watch for:** CAUTION -> DEFENSIVE transitions are the worst -- the damage hits fast at -4.45% within just 10 days (only 32% win rate) and deepens to -5.27% at 20 days. If the score keeps dropping, get out immediately. CAUTION -> NEUTRAL transitions mean the warning passed, but returns are still muted at 10 days (-1.08%) -- wait for confirmation before adding back aggressively.

## 🔴 DEFENSIVE

**Frequency:** ~10% of trading days

**What it means:** Multiple warning signals are firing. The trend is broken or breaking. Historically, these are the periods that produce the corrections TSLA is famous for -- the -30% to -50% drawdowns that destroy leveraged positions.

**The stats:**
- Average 20-day forward return: **-1.84%**
- Win rate: **43%**
- 60-day average: **-6.73%**

**What to do:** Be in cash. No leveraged exposure. This is capital preservation mode -- your only job is to survive this period with your account intact so you can reload when conditions improve. The -6.73% average at 60 days means this isn't a quick dip that bounces. It's structural deterioration that takes time to repair.

**When to re-enter:** NOT when the score ticks up to CAUTION. The data shows DEFENSIVE -> CAUTION still averages -3.10% at 10 days and -4.75% at 20 days -- the damage isn't done, it's a trap. Wait for DEFENSIVE -> NEUTRAL (+3.94% avg at 20 days, 67% win rate). That's the real "worst is over" signal. Be patient. The buy signal will come.

**Why this zone exists:** DEFENSIVE days are only 10% of all trading days. But they contain the corrections that account for the majority of TSLA's annual losses. Avoiding leverage during these 10% of days is the single highest-value thing the Orb does. This is what you're paying for.

## The Big Picture

| Zone | Days | Avg 20d Return | Win Rate | What You Do |
|------|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| 🟢 FULL SEND | 15% | **+6.22%** | **66%** | Deploy leveraged |
| ⚪ NEUTRAL | 51% | +4.22% | 52% | Hold. Don't add, don't trim. |
| 🟡 CAUTION | 24% | -1.24% | 41% | Take profits on leveraged |
| 🔴 DEFENSIVE | 10% | -1.84% | 43% | Cash. Wait. |

**Spread between top and bottom zones:** 7.64 percentage points at 20 days. 19.76 percentage points at 60 days.

The Orb doesn't predict the future. It measures current conditions and tells you what historically happens next when conditions look like this. Over 1,005 trading days, the zones separate cleanly -- each one strictly worse than the one above it, no exceptions.

Your edge isn't being right every time. Your edge is being leveraged during the 15% of days that produce the best outcomes, and being in cash during the 10% that produce the worst.
