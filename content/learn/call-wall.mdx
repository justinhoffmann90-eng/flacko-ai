## What is the Call Wall?

The **Call Wall** is the strike price with the highest concentration of open call interest. It acts as an **upside magnet** — price tends to gravitate toward it during bullish moves.

## Why It Matters

When traders buy calls, market makers (dealers) sell them. To hedge, dealers must **buy shares** as price rises toward the Call Wall. This buying pressure pulls price toward the level.

## Key Behaviors

- **Below the Call Wall**: Price often drifts upward toward it
- **At the Call Wall**: Expect resistance — dealers are fully hedged here
- **Above the Call Wall**: If price breaks through, dealers must chase — can accelerate moves

## How to Use It

1. **Target for longs**: If you're long, the Call Wall is a natural profit-taking zone
2. **Resistance level**: Expect selling pressure as price approaches
3. **Breakout signal**: A clean break above can trigger a gamma squeeze

## In the Daily Report

Look for the Call Wall in the **SpotGamma Levels** section. It's updated daily based on options flow.

*The Call Wall tells you where the upside magnet is. Trade toward it, not through it — unless it breaks.*
