## What Is the Call Wall?

The **Call Wall** is the strike price with the highest open call interest. It acts as an **upside magnet** — price gravitates toward it during bullish moves.

---

## Why It Works

| When | Dealer Action | Price Effect |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Price below Call Wall | Dealers buy shares to hedge | Pulls price up |
| Price at Call Wall | Dealers fully hedged | Resistance |
| Price above Call Wall | Dealers chase higher | Accelerated move |

---

## Call Wall Behavior

| Price Position | What Happens |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Well below** | Target — price tends to drift toward it |
| **Approaching** | Resistance builds, momentum slows |
| **At the level** | Expect rejection or consolidation |
| **Breaking through** | If clean break, can squeeze higher |

---

## How to Trade It

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Long below Call Wall | Use it as profit target |
| Price approaches | Tighten stops, reduce size |
| Price rejects | Look for short setup |
| Price breaks with volume | Trail stop, ride momentum |

---

## Call Wall vs Other Levels

| Level | Behavior | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Call Wall** | Upside magnet, then resistance | Profit targets |
| **Gamma Strike** | Reaction zone | Entry/exit triggers |
| **Put Wall** | Downside support | Buying opportunities |

## Example

```
$450 ─────── Call Wall (heavy call OI)
       │
       │    ← Price gravitates here
       │
$420 ─────── Current price
       │
       │
$400 ─────── Put Wall
```

**Trade:** Long from $420, target $445-$450 (just below Call Wall)

## Key Takeaways

| Point | Remember |
|-------|----------|
| Call Wall = upside magnet | Price pulls toward it |
| Resistance once reached | Don't expect easy breakthrough |
| Profit target for longs | Sell into it, not through it |
| Breaks are powerful | If broken, chase can accelerate |

---

*The Call Wall tells you where to take profits. Trade toward it, not through it — unless it breaks.*
