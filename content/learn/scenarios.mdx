## Why scenarios exist

Markets are probabilistic. Scenarios help you **prepare for multiple outcomes** instead of getting trapped in one bias.

## The three cases

### Bull case
- Higher‑probability path when the trend is strong
- Expect continuation and higher highs
- Look for breakouts and trend holds

### Base case
- The most likely outcome on most days
- Range‑bound or slow grind
- Focus on clean entries near key levels

### Bear case
- Risk‑off path when support breaks
- Expect faster moves and downside volatility
- Defensive sizing and quick exits

## How to apply scenarios

- **Weight your size** toward the higher‑probability case.
- **Match setups** to the scenario that’s playing out.
- **Stay flexible.** If price invalidates the base case, switch to the next scenario.

Scenarios don’t predict the future — they **prepare you for it**.
