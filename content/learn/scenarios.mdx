## Why Scenarios?

We don't predict. We **prepare for multiple outcomes**.

Every day has three scenarios with assigned probabilities. This keeps you flexible and prevents tunnel vision.

---

## The Three Scenarios

| Scenario | What It Means | Typical Probability |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 🐂 **Bull** | Breakout higher, above key resistance | 15-35% |
| 📊 **Base** | Range-bound, choppy action | 40-60% |
| 🐻 **Bear** | Breakdown lower, below key support | 15-35% |

---

## How Probabilities Are Set

| Factor | Bullish Signal | Bearish Signal |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Gamma positioning** | Positive gamma, above strike | Negative gamma, below strike |
| **Key levels** | Price near Put Wall | Price near Call Wall |
| **HIRO** | Sustained positive | Sustained negative |
| **Technical trend** | Above weekly EMAs | Below weekly EMAs |
| **Volatility** | Low VIX, contracting | High VIX, expanding |

---

## Using Scenarios

### Read the Probabilities
> **Bull 25% | Base 55% | Bear 20%**

This tells you:
- Base case (range) is most likely
- Slight bullish tilt (25% vs 20%)
- Don't expect a big move either way

### Adjust Your Plan

| Scenario Weight | Trading Approach |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Base dominant (50%+)** | Fade extremes, sell rips, buy dips |
| **Bull dominant (40%+)** | Look for breakout entries |
| **Bear dominant (40%+)** | Look for breakdown entries |
| **Split evenly** | Reduce size, wait for clarity |

---

## Scenario Triggers

Each scenario has **levels that confirm it**:

| Scenario | Confirmed When |
|----------|----------------|
| 🐂 **Bull** | Price breaks and holds above Call Wall |
| 📊 **Base** | Price stays between Call Wall and Put Wall |
| 🐻 **Bear** | Price breaks and holds below Put Wall |

---

## Example

> **Today's Scenarios:**
> 
> | Scenario | Probability | Trigger Level |
> |----------|-------------|---------------|
> | Bull | 20% | Break above $430 |
> | Base | 60% | Hold $410-$430 |
> | Bear | 20% | Break below $410 |
> 
> **Your plan:**
> - Expect range ($410-$430)
> - Fade moves to extremes
> - If $430 breaks, flip to bull mode
> - If $410 breaks, flip to bear mode

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Only planning for one scenario | Plan all three |
| Ignoring base case | Base is often most likely |
| Fighting the trigger | If bull confirms, don't stay bearish |

---

## Key Takeaway

Scenarios keep you **prepared, not predicted**. When the market tells you which scenario is playing out, you already have a plan.
