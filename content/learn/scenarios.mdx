## Why scenarios matter

Most traders improvise. Price goes up, they figure out what to do. Price goes down, they panic.

Scenario planning means you've **already thought through each outcome** before it happens. When the move comes, you execute — you don't scramble.

## The three scenarios

Every Flacko AI report maps three potential paths:

### 🟢 Bull Scenario
What happens if buyers take control. The triggers, targets, and what to watch for. Usually involves reclaiming key resistance or holding critical support with strength.

### ⚖️ Base Scenario  
The most likely path based on current structure. Often involves range-bound action between key levels. The "nothing dramatic" outcome that still has trading opportunities.

### 🔴 Bear Scenario
What happens if sellers take control. The breakdown levels, targets, and warning signs. Usually involves losing key support or failing at resistance with volume.

## How scenarios are built

Each scenario includes:

- **Trigger**: What price action or level breach activates this scenario
- **Target**: Where price is likely to go once the scenario is in play
- **What to do**: Size guidance and action steps based on your mode

## Using scenarios in real time

**Pre-market**: Read all three scenarios. Know what would trigger each.

**During the day**: As price moves, you're watching for trigger conditions. Not reacting to price — reacting to structure.

**When triggered**: Execute the plan for that scenario. The thinking is already done.

## Example scenario set

> **Bull Scenario** 🟢  
> Trigger: Hold $400 Put Wall and reclaim $420  
> Target: $440 Gamma Strike test  
> Action: Scale into longs, trail stops below $415  

> **Base Scenario** ⚖️  
> Trigger: Chop between $400-$420  
> Target: Range-bound, watch for directional break  
> Action: Scalp the range, no size for holds  

> **Bear Scenario** 🔴  
> Trigger: Lose $400 Put Wall with volume  
> Target: $385 next support  
> Action: Avoid longs, consider hedges, wait for stabilization
