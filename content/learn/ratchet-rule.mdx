## What Is the Ratchet Rule?

The Ratchet Rule governs how you transition between modes. Like a ratchet wrench, you move one click at a time — you can't jump from GREEN to RED or vice versa.

**Core principle:** As conditions deteriorate, you reduce size and require better prices. As conditions improve, you gradually increase exposure.

## The Escalation Ladder

```
GREEN (30% cap, 85% max)
   ↓ ↑
YELLOW Improving (20% cap, 70% max)
   ↓ ↑
YELLOW (17.5% cap, 60% max)
   ↓ ↑
ORANGE (10% cap, 40% max)
   ↓ ↑
RED (5% cap, 20% max)
   ↓
EJECTED (0% cap, 50% core)
```

**Downgrades:** Move down one step as conditions weaken.
**Upgrades:** Move up one step as conditions improve.

## Ratcheting Down

| Transition | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| GREEN → YELLOW | BX-Trender fading, testing 9 EMA | Reduce cap to 17.5-20%, tighten entries |
| YELLOW → ORANGE | BX-Trender red, below 13 EMA | Reduce cap to 10%, nibbles only |
| ORANGE → RED | BX-Trender LL, below 21 EMA | Reduce cap to 5%, prepare for eject |
| RED → EJECTED | Two closes below W21 EMA | Cut leverage, trim to 50% |

**Key insight:** Each step down gives you time to adjust. You're never blindsided by a sudden shift from full offense to full defense.

---

## Ratcheting Up

| Transition | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| EJECTED → RED | Reclaim W21 + HIRO positive | Resume 5% cap, leverage still cut |
| RED → ORANGE | Daily BX improving, holds key level | Increase cap to 10% |
| ORANGE → YELLOW | Structure rebuilding, EMA reclaims | Increase cap to 17.5% |
| YELLOW → GREEN | All timeframes aligned bullish | Full 30% cap, rebuild max invested |

**Why gradual upgrades?** You rebuild trust in the trend one step at a time. A single green day doesn't undo structural damage.

## The Hysteresis Rule

**Don't flip-flop modes based on single days.**

| Scenario | Wrong Response | Right Response |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| One red day in uptrend | Downgrade to YELLOW | Stay GREEN, watch for pattern |
| One green day in downtrend | Upgrade to GREEN | Stay current mode, watch for confirmation |
| Choppy week | Change mode daily | Pick the dominant condition |

**Exceptions to hysteresis:**
- Master Eject triggers are always immediate (leverage)
- Slow Zone activates immediately (sizing)
- Downgrades to RED are always immediate (most dangerous)
- Material catalysts can accelerate upgrades

## Why Ratcheting Works

### The Problem It Solves

Without ratcheting:
- You go all-in at the first dip
- Correction deepens, you're stuck
- You panic sell at the bottom
- Recovery happens, you're in cash

With ratcheting:
- Each dip gets smaller position size
- Correction deepens, you still have cash
- You nibble at key support levels
- Recovery happens, you're positioned

### The Math

Imagine a 20% correction in YELLOW mode (17.5% cap):

| Day | Price | Cap | Deployed | Notes |
|-----|-------|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | -3% | 17.5% | 17.5% | First dip buy |
| 2 | -5% | 17.5% | 17.5% | Second buy |
| 3 | -8% | 10%* | 10% | Downgrade to ORANGE |
| 4 | -12% | 10% | 10% | Continue ORANGE |
| 5 | -15% | 5%* | 5% | Downgrade to RED |
| 6 | -18% | 5% | 5% | Nibble only |
| 7 | -20% | 0%* | 0% | EJECTED, cut leverage |

**Result:** You deployed 65% of cash with an average entry ~12% below the top. Without ratcheting, you might have deployed 100% in the first 3 days at -5% average.

## Rebuilding After Eject

Coming back from EJECTED is the slowest ratchet:

1. **Reclaim W21 EMA** with HIRO positive → Upgrade to RED
2. **Hold above W21 for 2+ days** → Consider ORANGE upgrade
3. **Reclaim D13 EMA** with improving BX → Upgrade to YELLOW
4. **Full EMA stack bullish** → Return to GREEN

**You can restart leverage at ORANGE** — but only small positions, not full size.

**Why so slow?** Structure that broke doesn't heal overnight. The slow rebuild protects you from dead cat bounces.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Jumping straight to RED on fear | Follow the ladder, one step at a time |
| Jumping straight to GREEN on hope | Rebuild trust gradually |
| Ignoring mode because "it'll bounce" | The mode is the system's opinion, not yours |
| Overriding the ratchet with conviction | Conviction doesn't prevent drawdowns |

---

## Key Takeaway

The Ratchet Rule keeps you from making emotional jumps. **One click at a time** — whether conditions are improving or deteriorating.

As conditions worsen: reduce size, require better prices.
As conditions improve: increase size, trust the trend.

*The ladder is your friend. Climb it step by step.*
