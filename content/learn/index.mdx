Most traders lose because they trade feelings instead of structure. They chase. They panic. They guess.

This isn't that.

Flacko AI is a **trading operating system** for TSLA. Daily reports, key levels, risk modes, and alerts — all built on one principle: **structure over sentiment.**

## ⚔️ The Bottom Line

Every day, you get:

- **The mode** — How aggressive to be (green/yellow/orange/red)
- **The levels** — Where support and resistance actually live
- **The scenarios** — What to expect if price goes up, down, or sideways
- **Real-time alerts** — When key levels are tested

No predictions. No hype. No guessing.

Just the structure. Every day. For TSLA.
