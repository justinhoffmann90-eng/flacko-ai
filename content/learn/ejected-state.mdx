## What Is the EJECTED State?

EJECTED is the most defensive state in the system. It activates when price closes below the Weekly 21 EMA for **two consecutive days**, confirming structural breakdown.

| Metric | EJECTED State |
|--------|---------------|
| Daily Cap | 0% (normal rules suspended) |
| Max Position | 50% core TSLA only |
| Leverage | None — all TSLL/options sold |
| Deployment | Only via 200 SMA Override |

---

## How You Get Here

**Day 1:** Price closes below W21 EMA
- Action: Sell ALL leverage (TSLL, options) immediately
- Status: Still in normal mode, watching for confirmation

**Day 2:** Price closes below W21 EMA again
- Action: Trim TSLA to 50% of portfolio
- Status: Enter EJECTED state

**Why two closes?** Single-day wicks below W21 are common and often reverse. Two consecutive closes confirm the break is real.

---

## What You Hold in EJECTED

| Position | Status | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| TSLA shares | 50% of portfolio | Core exposure for recovery |
| TSLL | 0% | Too risky — can go to zero |
| Options | 0% | Time decay + volatility crush |
| Cash | 50% of portfolio | Dry powder for Override deployment |

**Why 50% shares, not 0%?** The bull thesis may still be intact even though structure is damaged. You want exposure for the recovery, but you've cut risk by eliminating leverage.

---

## What You CAN'T Do

In EJECTED state, normal mode rules are suspended:

- ❌ No buying via daily cap (cap = 0%)
- ❌ No leverage positions
- ❌ No "nibbling at support" via normal rules

**What EJECTED prevents:** The temptation to catch the falling knife. When structure breaks, you need to let it stabilize — not keep averaging down.

---

## What You CAN Do

The **200 SMA Oversold Override** is the only deployment mechanism:

| Trigger | Max Allocation | Instruments |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| 20%+ below 200 SMA | 10% | TSLA shares only |
| 30%+ below 200 SMA | 25% | 60% TSLA / 40% TSLL |
| 40%+ below 200 SMA | 40% | 40% TSLA / 60% TSLL |

**Why Override works in EJECTED:** At these extreme levels, the risk/reward is asymmetric. Even if structure is broken, a 30% discount to the 200 SMA represents generational value.

---

## Getting Out of EJECTED

To exit EJECTED state and return to normal modes, you need:

1. **Reclaim W21 EMA** — Price closes ABOVE W21
2. **HIRO confirmation** — Dealer flow positive
3. **Hold for 2+ days** — Confirm the reclaim is real

**First step out:** EJECTED → RED (5% cap)

You don't jump back to GREEN. You ratchet up slowly, rebuilding trust in the trend.

---

## The Recovery Ladder

| Current State | Trigger | Next State |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| EJECTED | Reclaim W21 + HIRO positive | RED |
| RED | Hold above W21, Daily BX improving | ORANGE |
| ORANGE | Reclaim D13, structure rebuilding | YELLOW |
| YELLOW | All timeframes aligned bullish | GREEN |

**Why so slow?** Broken structure doesn't heal in a day. Dead cat bounces happen. The slow rebuild protects you from false recoveries.

---

## EJECTED State Psychology

Being EJECTED feels terrible. You've cut leverage, trimmed shares, and you're watching TSLA move without you.

**The temptation:** "Maybe I should buy back — it's bouncing!"

**The reality:** 
- The first bounce after a breakdown often fails
- You already have 50% exposure for the recovery
- If it's a real recovery, you'll have time to rebuild
- If it fails, you protected capital

**What to focus on:**
- Let the Override deploy for you at extreme levels
- Wait for confirmed W21 reclaim
- Follow the ratchet ladder back up

## Example Scenario

**Week 1:**
- Monday: TSLA closes at $412, below W21 ($420)
- Action: Sell all TSLL and options
- Tuesday: TSLA closes at $405 (second close below W21)
- Action: Trim TSLA to 50% of portfolio, enter EJECTED

**Week 2:**
- TSLA bounces to $415, then falls to $390
- Temptation: "Should I buy the bounce?"
- Right action: You're EJECTED, cap = 0%. Let it play out.

**Week 3:**
- TSLA falls to $330 (25% below 200 SMA at $440)
- Override Tier 1 activates: Deploy up to 10% in TSLA shares
- Action: Buy $5,000/day in TSLA shares

**Week 4:**
- TSLA bottoms at $310, stabilizes
- Rallies back to $380, HIRO turns positive
- TSLA closes above W21 ($415) on Friday
- Action: Exit EJECTED, enter RED mode (5% cap)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Buying the first bounce | Dead cat bounces fail — wait for confirmation |
| Holding leverage through EJECTED | Leverage in crashes = zero risk |
| Trimming to 0% instead of 50% | You need exposure for the recovery |
| Trying to time the exact bottom | Override tiers do this for you systematically |
| Jumping straight to GREEN after reclaim | Use the ladder — one step at a time |

---

## Key Takeaway

EJECTED is uncomfortable but necessary. It forces you to **stop digging** when you're in a hole. Cut leverage, hold 50% core, let the Override deploy at extreme levels, and wait for confirmed recovery before rebuilding.

*EJECTED isn't failure — it's capital preservation. The best traders know when to step back.*
