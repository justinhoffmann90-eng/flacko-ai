## The System at a Glance

Flacko AI is a **risk-first trading system** for TSLA. Every day, you get:

1. **A Daily Report** — Pre-market analysis with mode, levels, and scenarios
2. **Price Alerts** — Real-time notifications when price hits key levels
3. **A Weekly Review** — End-of-week analysis and preparation for next week

The goal: **Know your risk before the open. React to levels with a plan.**

## Your Daily Workflow

### Before the Open (Pre-Market)

1. **Read the Daily Report** — Takes 2-3 minutes
2. **Check the Mode** — Green, Yellow, Orange, or Red
3. **Note Key Levels** — Gamma Strike, Call Wall, Put Wall
4. **Know Your Cap** — How much you can deploy today

### During the Session

1. **Watch for Alerts** — You'll get notified when price hits levels
2. **Follow the Action** — Each alert tells you what to do
3. **Respect the Mode** — Don't exceed your daily cap

### After the Close

1. **Review What Happened** — Did levels hold? Did scenarios play out?
2. **Note Lessons** — What worked, what didn't
3. **Prepare for Tomorrow** — Mental reset
