## What Is the 200 SMA Override?

The 200 SMA Override is a special deployment rule that activates when TSLA falls dramatically below its 200-day Simple Moving Average. It's designed for **extreme oversold conditions** — the kind that happen once every few years.

**When it activates:** EJECTED state (below W21 for 2+ closes)
**What it allows:** Systematic deployment into deeply oversold conditions
**Normal rules:** Suspended — Override takes over

## The Three Tiers

| Tier | Trigger | Max Allocation | Instruments | Daily Rate | Stabilization |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | 20%+ below 200 SMA | 10% of portfolio | TSLA shares only | 5%/day | None required |
| **Tier 2** | 30%+ below 200 SMA | 25% of portfolio | 60% TSLA / 40% TSLL | 10%/day | 2 days no new lows |
| **Tier 3** | 40%+ below 200 SMA | 40% of portfolio | 40% TSLA / 60% TSLL | 15%/day | 2 days no new lows |

---

## Why This Exists

Normal mode rules (GREEN through RED) are designed for **normal market conditions**. When TSLA falls 20-40% below its 200 SMA, conditions are no longer normal — they're generational.

**The problem with normal rules in crashes:**
- EJECTED state = 0% daily cap
- You sit in cash watching the flush
- Best buying opportunity in years
- You miss the bottom

**The solution:**
- Override kicks in at extreme levels
- Systematic deployment as fear peaks
- You catch the generational low
- Risk is managed via tiers

---

## Tier 1: The First Signal (20%+ Below)

**Trigger:** TSLA is 20%+ below its 200 SMA

**Example:** 200 SMA at $350, TSLA at $280 (20% below)

**What you can do:**
- Deploy up to 10% of portfolio
- TSLA shares only — no leverage
- 5% per day max
- No stabilization required

**Why shares only?** At Tier 1, you don't know if this is the bottom. Shares recover; leveraged products during crashes can go to zero. You're testing the water.

---

## Tier 2: Getting Serious (30%+ Below)

**Trigger:** TSLA is 30%+ below its 200 SMA

**Example:** 200 SMA at $350, TSLA at $245 (30% below)

**What you can do:**
- Deploy up to 25% of portfolio
- 60% in TSLA / 40% in TSLL
- 10% per day max
- Requires 2 days with no new lows first

**Why add TSLL?** At this depth, you're likely near a bottom. TSLL gives you leverage for the recovery. But the stabilization requirement (2 days no new lows) confirms the flush is pausing.

---

## Tier 3: Maximum Opportunity (40%+ Below)

**Trigger:** TSLA is 40%+ below its 200 SMA

**Example:** 200 SMA at $350, TSLA at $210 (40% below)

**What you can do:**
- Deploy up to 40% of portfolio
- 40% in TSLA / 60% in TSLL
- 15% per day max
- Requires 2 days with no new lows first

**Why more TSLL?** At 40% below the 200 SMA, TSLA has only happened a handful of times in history. This is a generational buying opportunity. TSLL maximizes your upside for the recovery.

---

## The Stabilization Requirement

For Tier 2 and Tier 3, you must wait for **2 days with no new lows** before deploying.

**What counts as "no new low":**
- Two consecutive daily closes above the most recent low
- Not wicks — actual closes

**Why this matters:**
- Crashes often have multiple flush days
- Stabilization confirms the panic is subsiding
- Buying into an active flush = catching a falling knife
- Buying after stabilization = buying the floor

**Example:**
- Monday: TSLA low at $220, closes at $225
- Tuesday: TSLA closes at $228 (above $220 low) — Day 1 ✓
- Wednesday: TSLA closes at $232 (above $220 low) — Day 2 ✓
- Thursday: Tier 2/3 deployment allowed

## Combining With Master Eject

The 200 SMA Override works **after** Master Eject has triggered:

1. W21 breaks → Cut leverage, trim to 50%
2. Put Wall breaks → Trim to 50% if not done
3. 20% below 200 SMA → Tier 1 Override activates
4. 30% below 200 SMA → Tier 2 Override activates
5. 40% below 200 SMA → Tier 3 Override activates

**You're not abandoning risk management.** You cut leverage and trimmed during the breakdown. Now you're systematically re-entering at extreme levels.

---

## Historical Context

TSLA has reached these levels only a few times:

| Date | Distance Below 200 SMA | Tier | Outcome |
|------|------------------------|------|---------|
| March 2020 | ~40% | Tier 3 | +1,500% over next year |
| Dec 2022 | ~35% | Tier 2 | +150% over next year |
| Jan 2024 | ~25% | Tier 1 | +40% over next 3 months |

**These are the opportunities the Override is designed for.** They're rare, they're terrifying, and they're where fortunes are made.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Ignoring stabilization requirement | Buying during active flush = more pain |
| Using TSLL at Tier 1 | Too early — shares only until deeper levels |
| Deploying full tier in one day | Use the daily rate limit — spread entries |
| Waiting for "the perfect bottom" | You won't time it — tiers give you exposure |

## Example Walkthrough

**Setup:** 200 SMA at $350, portfolio $100,000

**Friday:** TSLA at $280 (20% below) — Tier 1 activates
- Max allocation: $10,000
- Today's limit: $5,000
- Action: Buy $5,000 TSLA shares

**Monday:** TSLA at $260 (26% below) — still Tier 1
- Already deployed $5,000
- Room to add: $5,000 more
- Action: Buy $5,000 TSLA shares (Tier 1 full)

**Wednesday:** TSLA at $240 (31% below) — Tier 2 activates
- Check: 2 days no new lows? Not yet (just made new low)
- Action: Wait for stabilization

**Thursday:** TSLA closes at $245
- Day 1 of stabilization (above $240 low)

**Friday:** TSLA closes at $248
- Day 2 of stabilization ✓
- Tier 2 unlocked: $25,000 max (have $10,000 deployed = $15,000 room)
- Today's limit: $10,000
- Action: Buy $6,000 TSLA + $4,000 TSLL (60/40 split)

## Key Takeaway

The 200 SMA Override turns crashes into opportunities. When everyone is panicking, you have a plan: **deploy systematically at extreme levels, respect stabilization, scale from shares to leverage as depth increases.**

*The deepest drawdowns are the best buying opportunities. The Override lets you capitalize.*
