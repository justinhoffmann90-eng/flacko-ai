## What the Call Options System Is

The Call Options system is a **separate signal engine** from the share-buying framework.

- Separate signals
- Separate budget
- Separate risk decisions

It is evaluated daily with a rule-based decision tree.

---

## State Labels

| State | Color | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| **ACTIVE** | Green | Conditions support call setups |
| **WATCHING** | Amber | Mixed conditions; monitor for confirmation |
| **AVOID** | Red | Conditions are unfavorable for calls |
| **NO_SIGNAL** | Gray | No valid setup or trigger currently active |

---

## Decision Tree Logic (First Match Wins)

The system runs in sequence each day:

1. **Avoid conditions checked first**
2. Oversold override logic checked next
3. Buy setup conditions checked
4. First valid branch sets the daily state

This prevents conflicting interpretations and forces one clear output.

## The 2 Avoid Signals

| Avoid Signal | General Description |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Extended & Fading** | Price stretched while momentum/participation weakens |
| **Accelerating Downtrend** | Downward structure strengthening too quickly for long calls |

If either avoid condition is met, the system prioritizes defense.

## The 7 Buy Setup Families

The model includes seven buy setup types (names and broad intent):

| Setup Family | General Intent |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Reclaim Setup** | Regain key structure after weakness |
| **Support Bounce Setup** | Hold-and-react at major support |
| **Gamma Alignment Setup** | Favorable dealer positioning and level alignment |
| **Trend Continuation Setup** | Existing uptrend resumes after consolidation |
| **Breakout Confirmation Setup** | Resistance clears with follow-through |
| **Oversold Reversal Setup** | Mean-reversion rebound with confirmation |
| **Momentum Expansion Setup** | Improving participation supports continuation |

The engine is backed by analysis across **829 trading days**.

## How to Read the Dashboard Widget

The Call Options widget gives a quick operational read:

- Current state (ACTIVE / WATCHING / AVOID / NO_SIGNAL)
- Brief rationale for the state
- Any caution tags (e.g., avoid condition active)

Use this as your options posture header before selecting trades.

---

## What the System Does NOT Tell You

This system does **not** currently validate exact contract selection details, including:

- Delta
- Expiry
- Strike selection

You still need contract-level risk management.

---

## Relationship to the Share System

Call options and shares are connected by market context but managed separately.

| Layer | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Share system | Core accumulation/distribution via mode caps |
| Call system | Tactical options exposure via separate state engine |

Do not treat call signals as permission to override share-mode sizing rules.

---

## Key Takeaway

The Call Options system is a structured, separate decision layer:
- Avoid first
- Then setup evaluation
- One clear daily state
- Separate budget from share caps
