## Why Systematic Trimming?

Most traders have a plan for **buying** but no plan for **selling**. They either:
- Hold too long and give back gains
- Sell too early and miss the run
- Make emotional decisions at resistance

Trim caps solve this. **You know exactly how much to sell at each level before the market opens.**

---

## The Trim Cap by Mode

| Mode | Trim Cap | Logic |
|------|----------|-------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 10% of remaining | Trend supports holding — trim slowly, let winners run |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 20% of remaining | Symmetrical pacing — balanced approach |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 25% of remaining | Bounces suspect — trim faster, lock in gains |
| 🔴 RED | 30% of remaining | Bounces are exits — trim aggressively |

**"Of remaining"** means each trim is a percentage of what you currently hold, not your original position.

---

## How It Works

**Example: $40,000 TSLA position in ORANGE mode (25% trim cap)**

| Level Hit | Trim Amount | Position After | Gain Locked |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| T1 | $40,000 × 25% = $10,000 | $30,000 | $10,000 |
| T2 | $30,000 × 25% = $7,500 | $22,500 | $17,500 |
| T3 | $22,500 × 25% = $5,625 | $16,875 | $23,125 |
| T4 | $16,875 × 25% = $4,219 | $12,656 | $27,344 |

**Result:** You still hold 32% of your original position ($12,656 / $40,000) for further upside, but you've locked in 68% of profits.

## The Four Trim Levels

Every daily report defines four trim levels (T1-T4):

| Level | Typical Anchor | Distance | Priority |
|-------|----------------|----------|----------|
| T1 | Daily 9 EMA | +1-2% | Start trim sequence |
| T2 | Weekly 21 EMA | +3-4% | Key trend level |
| T3 | Weekly 13 EMA | +5-6% | Strong momentum |
| T4 | Call Wall | +8-10% | Extension zone |

**Why these levels?** Each represents a natural resistance point where price often stalls or reverses. By trimming at these levels, you're locking in gains where the market naturally pauses.

## Why Mode Affects Trim Speed

### GREEN Mode (10% trim cap)

**Context:** Trend is healthy, momentum is strong.
**Logic:** Don't fight the trend. Small trims preserve upside.
**Outcome:** If TSLA rips from $400 to $500, you still hold 66% at T4.

### RED Mode (30% trim cap)

**Context:** Structure is broken, bounces are suspect.
**Logic:** This could be a dead cat bounce. Take profits aggressively.
**Outcome:** If TSLA bounces from $350 to $400, you've locked in 76% by T4.

**The asymmetry:** In RED, you want to get out because the bounce might fail. In GREEN, you want to stay in because the trend might continue.

---

## The "Of Remaining" Rule

Each trim is calculated from your **current position**, not original.

**Wrong:** "I bought $50,000, trim 25% = $12,500 at each level"
**Right:** "Trim 25% of what I hold NOW at each level"

**Why?** Compound trimming naturally slows your exits. You never sell out completely, but you progressively reduce risk.

| Trim # | Position Before | 25% Trim | Position After | % of Original |
|--------|-----------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | $50,000 | $12,500 | $37,500 | 75% |
| 2 | $37,500 | $9,375 | $28,125 | 56% |
| 3 | $28,125 | $7,031 | $21,094 | 42% |
| 4 | $21,094 | $5,273 | $15,821 | 32% |

## Combining Buys and Trims

**What if you're still accumulating?**

The daily cap (buying) and trim cap (selling) can both be active. If TSLA hits a buy level, you buy per your cap. If it hits a trim level, you trim per your cap.

**Example day in YELLOW (17.5% buy cap, 20% trim cap):**
- Morning: TSLA at $405 (S1 buy level) → Deploy $5,000
- Afternoon: TSLA rallies to $417 (T1 trim level) → Trim 20% of position

**Net effect:** You bought low and trimmed high on the same day. That's the system working.

---

## Extension Trimming

When price gets too far above the Weekly 9 EMA (typically >7-8%), you may trim even before hitting a named level.

| Extension Above W9 | Action |
|--------------------|--------|
| 5-7% | Normal operations |
| 7-10% | Consider extra trim |
| 10%+ | Aggressive trim regardless of mode |

**Why?** Extended moves tend to snap back. Even in GREEN mode, being 15% above W9 EMA is unsustainable.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Skipping T1 because "it'll go higher" | T1 is where you START trimming, not decide |
| Trimming full position at one level | Use the cap — spread exits like you spread entries |
| Not trimming in GREEN because "trend is good" | Even good trends pull back — lock something in |
| Trimming more than the cap | Over-trimming leaves you underexposed for continuation |

---

## Example: Full Trim Sequence

**Setup:**
- Mode: 🟡 YELLOW (20% trim cap)
- Position: $30,000 in TSLA at $400 avg
- T1: $417, T2: $424, T3: $434, T4: $450

**Monday:** TSLA hits $417 (T1)
- Trim: $30,000 × 20% = $6,000
- Position: $24,000

**Wednesday:** TSLA hits $424 (T2)
- Trim: $24,000 × 20% = $4,800
- Position: $19,200

**Friday:** TSLA hits $434 (T3)
- Trim: $19,200 × 20% = $3,840
- Position: $15,360

**Following week:** TSLA hits $450 (T4)
- Trim: $15,360 × 20% = $3,072
- Position: $12,288

**Result:** Locked in $17,712 in profits. Still hold $12,288 (41% of original) for further upside.

## Key Takeaway

Trim caps remove emotion from selling. **At each level, you know exactly what to do.** Small trims in strong trends. Larger trims in weak trends. Always "of remaining" so you never sell out completely.

*Buy with a plan. Sell with a plan. The trim cap is your sell plan.*
