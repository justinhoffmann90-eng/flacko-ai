## Why Trim Caps Matter

Most traders have buy rules but no sell discipline. Trim caps solve that by defining exactly how much to reduce at each resistance level.

---

## Trim Caps by Mode

| Mode | Trim Cap | Intent |
|------|----------|--------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 10% per level | Let trends run, trim lightly |
| 🟡 YELLOW (Improving) | **15%** | Recovering structure, still controlled |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 20% | Balanced offense/defense |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 25% | Defensive posture, lock gains faster |
| 🔴 RED | 30% | Treat bounces as exit opportunities |

All trims are **of remaining position**, not original position.

---

## T-Level Hierarchy (Regime A)

Use this sequence when market is recovering but still below some key EMAs.

| T-Level | Anchor |
|---------|--------|
| T1 | Daily 9 EMA reclaim |
| T2 | Key Gamma Strike reclaim |
| T3 | Daily 21 EMA reclaim |
| T4 | Hedge Wall |
| T5 | Weekly 9 EMA |
| T6 | Weekly 13 EMA |
| T7 | Weekly 21 EMA |
| T8 | Prior swing high |

---

## T-Level Hierarchy (Regime B)

When price is already above all key EMAs (strong uptrend), hierarchy shifts:

| Priority | Anchor |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Hedge Wall |
| 2 | Most recent swing high |
| 3 | Major round numbers |
| 4 | EMA Extension Zone (% above W9 EMA) |
| 5 | Call Wall |
| 6 | All-time high / 52-week high |

This prevents over-reliance on reclaim logic once trend strength is already established.

---

## EMA Extension Trimming

If price extends far above Weekly 9 EMA, trim discipline becomes more important even in bullish mode.

| Extension Above W9 EMA | Guidance |
|------------------------|----------|
| ~12% | Start adding extra trims |
| ~18% | Increase trim aggressiveness |
| ~25% | Prioritize heavy risk reduction |

(Updated thresholds: **12% / 18% / 25%**)

## Example (ORANGE, 25% Trim Cap)

Starting position: $40,000

| Level | Trim | Remaining |
|------|------|-----------|
| T1 | $10,000 | $30,000 |
| T2 | $7,500 | $22,500 |
| T3 | $5,625 | $16,875 |
| T4 | $4,219 | $12,656 |

You lock in gains while still retaining a smaller runner.

## Key Takeaway

Trim caps are your anti-emotion sell system:
- Mode determines trim speed
- Regime determines level order
- Extension determines extra urgency
