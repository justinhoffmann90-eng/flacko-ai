## What Is the Put Wall?

The **Put Wall** is the strike price with the highest open put interest. It acts as a **downside floor** — price finds support here during selloffs.

---

## Why It Works

| When | Dealer Action | Price Effect |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Price above Put Wall | Dealers hold short hedges | Normal trading |
| Price at Put Wall | Dealer selling exhausted | Support |
| Price below Put Wall | Dealers must sell more | Accelerated drop |

---

## Put Wall Behavior

| Price Position | What Happens |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Well above** | Normal support below |
| **Approaching** | Selling pressure increases |
| **At the level** | Expect bounce attempt |
| **Breaking below** | If breaks, flush incoming |

---

## How to Trade It

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price dips to Put Wall | Look for bounce entry |
| Price holds on retest | Add to longs |
| Price rejects higher | Trail stop, strong support |
| Price breaks below | Reduce/exit, reassess |

---

## Put Wall vs Other Levels

| Level | Behavior | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Put Wall** | Downside floor | Buying dips |
| **Gamma Strike** | Reaction zone | Entry/exit triggers |
| **Call Wall** | Upside resistance | Profit targets |

---

## Example

```
$450 ─────── Call Wall
       │
       │
$420 ─────── Gamma Strike
       │
       │
$400 ─────── Current price
       │
$395 ─────── Put Wall (heavy put OI)
       │       ↑
       │       Support zone — look for bounce
```

**Trade:** If price tests $395-$400, watch for bounce confirmation, add per mode cap

## Key Takeaways

| Point | Remember |
|-------|----------|
| Put Wall = downside floor | Support, not guarantee |
| Bounce zone | Look for entries here |
| Respect the break | If lost, get defensive |
| Update after OpEx | Put Wall can shift significantly |

*The Put Wall is your safety net. Trust it until it breaks.*
