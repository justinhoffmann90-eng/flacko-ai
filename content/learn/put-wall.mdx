## What is the Put Wall?

The **Put Wall** is the strike price with the highest concentration of open put interest. It acts as a **downside floor** — price tends to find support here during selloffs.

## Why It Matters

When traders buy puts, market makers sell them. To hedge, dealers must **sell shares** as price falls toward the Put Wall. But once price reaches the level, that selling pressure exhausts — creating support.

## Key Behaviors

- **Above the Put Wall**: Normal trading, Put Wall is your safety net
- **At the Put Wall**: Expect support — dealers have completed their hedging
- **Below the Put Wall**: If price breaks through, dealers must sell more — can accelerate declines

## How to Use It

1. **Support level**: Look for bounces when price tests the Put Wall
2. **Risk management**: Breaking the Put Wall is a warning sign
3. **Entry zone**: Dips to the Put Wall can be buying opportunities in bull modes

## In the Daily Report

The Put Wall is in the **SpotGamma Levels** section. Watch how price reacts when it gets close.

*The Put Wall is your downside cushion. Respect it as support — but if it breaks, get defensive.*
