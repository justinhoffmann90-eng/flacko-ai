## The Golden Rule

**Never exceed your mode caps — daily or max invested.**

---

## The Three Caps

| Cap Type | What It Limits | Calculated From |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Daily Buy Cap** | How much you can deploy today | % of available cash |
| **Max Invested Cap** | How much total TSLA exposure you can hold | % of total portfolio |
| **Trim Cap** | How much to reduce at each trim level | % of remaining position |

---

## Mode Caps Reference

| Mode | Daily Buy Cap | Max Invested Cap | Trim Cap |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 30% rulebook (subscriber view: up to 25%) | 85% | 10% |
| 🟡 YELLOW (Improving) | 20% | 70% | **15%** |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 17.5% | 60% | 20% |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | 40% | 25% |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | 20% | 30% |
| ⬛ EJECTED | 0% (oversold override only) | 50% core hold | N/A |

---

## Slow Zone Adjustment

When price closes below **D21 EMA × 0.98**, Slow Zone applies.

| Mode | Normal Cap | Slow Zone Cap |
|------|------------|---------------|
| 🟡 YELLOW | 17.5% | 8.75% |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | **2.5%** |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | **1.25%** |

- Slow Zone is inactive in GREEN and YELLOW (Improving).
- In ORANGE/RED, Slow Zone reduces to **25% of normal cap** (not 50%).

---

## Calculation Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Cap
`Daily Buy Capacity = Available Cash × Mode Daily Cap`

### Step 2: Calculate Max Room
`Max Room = (Portfolio × Max Invested Cap) - Current Exposure`

### Step 3: Use the Lower Number
Your actionable buy size is the lower of:
- daily buy capacity, or
- max room

## Max Invested Caps Are Tiered Guidance

Mode downgrades are managed progressively in most cases.

| Transition | Guidance |
|------------|----------|
| GREEN → YELLOW | No forced selling; slower buying pace usually self-corrects |
| YELLOW → ORANGE | Soft recommendation to reduce if above ~50-60% |
| ORANGE → RED | Strong suggestion to work toward ~20-30% |
| Any mode → EJECTED | Mandatory: remove leverage, trim to 50% core |

**Key point:** Except EJECTED rules, max invested caps are primarily **risk guidance**, not auto-liquidation triggers.

## Example

**Portfolio:** $200,000  
**Cash:** $120,000  
**Current TSLA exposure:** $70,000  
**Mode:** ORANGE

- Daily buy capacity: $120,000 × 10% = $12,000
- Max room: ($200,000 × 40%) - $70,000 = $10,000
- Actionable max today: **$10,000**

If Slow Zone is active in ORANGE:
- Adjusted daily capacity: $120,000 × 2.5% = $3,000
- Actionable max: **$3,000**

## Key Takeaway

Correct sizing is a 3-part check:
1. Mode cap
2. Slow Zone adjustment
3. Max invested room

If all three align, you deploy. If not, you wait.
