## The Golden Rule

**Never exceed your mode caps — daily OR max invested.**

Everything else flows from this.

---

## The Three Caps

Every mode has three caps that work together:

| Cap Type | What It Limits | Calculated From |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Daily Cap** | How much you can deploy today | % of available cash |
| **Max Invested** | How much you can hold total | % of portfolio |
| **Trim Cap** | How much you trim at resistance | % of remaining position |

---

## Mode Caps Reference

| Mode | Daily Cap | Max Invested | Trim Cap |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 30% | 85% | 10% |
| 🟡 YELLOW (Improving) | 20% | 70% | 20% |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 17.5% | 60% | 20% |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | 40% | 25% |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | 20% | 30% |
| ⬛ EJECTED | 0%* | 50% | N/A |

*EJECTED allows deployment only via 200 SMA Override.

---

## How Daily Cap Works

**Daily cap = % of your available cash, not your portfolio.**

**Example: YELLOW mode (17.5% cap)**
- Portfolio: $100,000
- Current TSLA position: $40,000
- Available cash: $60,000
- Daily cap: $60,000 × 17.5% = **$10,500**

**The key insight:** As you deploy cash, your daily cap in dollar terms shrinks. This naturally paces your entries.

---

## How Max Invested Works

**Max invested = % of your total portfolio in TSLA positions.**

**Example: ORANGE mode (40% max)**
- Portfolio: $100,000
- Max TSLA position: $40,000
- Current position: $35,000
- Room to add: $5,000

**Even if you have cash and daily cap available**, you can't exceed max invested. This prevents overexposure in deteriorating conditions.

---

## The Slow Zone Modifier

When price is 2%+ below the Daily 21 EMA, the Slow Zone **halves** your daily cap.

| Mode | Normal Cap | With Slow Zone |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 30% | 15% |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 17.5% | 8.75% |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | 5% |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | 2.5% |

**Slow Zone is inactive** in GREEN and YELLOW (Improving) modes.

---

## Position Sizing Framework

### Step 1: Check Your Mode
Look at today's report for the current mode.

### Step 2: Calculate Daily Cap
```
Daily Cap = Available Cash × Mode %
```
If Slow Zone active, halve the result.

### Step 3: Check Max Invested
```
Room to Add = (Portfolio × Max Invested %) - Current Position
```
Your actual cap is the LOWER of daily cap and room to add.

### Step 4: Determine Conviction
| Conviction | % of Cap to Use |
|------------|-----------------|
| High (strong setup, multiple confirmations) | 75-100% |
| Medium (decent setup, some confluence) | 50-75% |
| Low (speculative, single signal) | 25-50% |

### Step 5: Calculate Position
```
Position Size = Daily Cap × Conviction %
```

---

## Example: Full Calculation

**Setup:**
- Portfolio: $200,000
- Current TSLA position: $50,000
- Available cash: $150,000
- Mode: YELLOW (17.5% cap, 60% max invested)
- Slow Zone: Active (price 3% below D21)
- Conviction: Medium (60%)

**Step 1:** Mode = YELLOW

**Step 2:** Daily Cap
- Base: $150,000 × 17.5% = $26,250
- Slow Zone halves it: $26,250 ÷ 2 = **$13,125**

**Step 3:** Max Invested Check
- Max position: $200,000 × 60% = $120,000
- Current: $50,000
- Room: $120,000 - $50,000 = **$70,000**

**Step 4:** Cap = lower of $13,125 and $70,000 = **$13,125**

**Step 5:** Position
- Conviction 60%: $13,125 × 60% = **$7,875**

**Result:** You can deploy up to $7,875 today.

## Scaling In

Don't deploy your full cap in one trade. Scale in:

| Entry | % of Position | When |
|-------|---------------|------|
| First | 40-50% | Initial signal, level touches |
| Second | 30-40% | Confirmation, level holds |
| Third | 20-30% | Strength, breakout confirmed |

**Why scale?**
- Reduces bad entry risk
- Improves average cost
- Lets you react to new information
- Keeps cash available for better setups

---

## When to Size Down

Even within your cap, size down for:

| Situation | Use This Much of Cap |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Late to the move | 50% |
| Conflicting signals | 50% |
| Near resistance | 50% |
| Multiple open positions | 50-75% |
| High VIX (>25) | 50-75% |
| First position after EJECTED | 50% |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Ignoring max invested | Check BEFORE deploying |
| Same size every trade | Adjust for mode + conviction |
| Ignoring Slow Zone | Halve cap when active |
| Going all-in on first entry | Scale in 3 entries |
| No cash reserve | Always keep some available |

---

## Key Takeaways

| Principle | Remember |
|-----------|----------|
| **Daily cap** | How much you can deploy TODAY |
| **Max invested** | How much you can hold TOTAL |
| **Trim cap** | How much you sell at each level |
| **Slow Zone** | Halves daily cap when active |
| **Scale in** | 3 entries beat 1 |
| **Cash is position** | Always keep some available |

*Size to survive. The best trade is the one you can hold.*
