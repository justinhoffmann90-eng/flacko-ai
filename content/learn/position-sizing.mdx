## The Golden Rule

**Never exceed your mode cap.** Everything else flows from this.

---

## Mode Caps

| Mode | Max Deployment | With $100K Portfolio |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 25% | $25,000 |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 15% | $15,000 |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | $10,000 |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | $5,000 |

## Position Sizing Framework

### Step 1: Know Your Cap
Check the mode in today's report.

### Step 2: Determine Conviction
| Conviction Level | % of Cap to Use |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **High** | 50-100% of cap |
| **Medium** | 25-50% of cap |
| **Low** | 10-25% of cap |

### Step 3: Calculate Position Size
```
Position Size = Portfolio × Mode Cap × Conviction %
```

**Example:**
- Portfolio: $100,000
- Mode: Yellow (15% cap)
- Conviction: Medium (40% of cap)
- Position: $100,000 × 0.15 × 0.40 = **$6,000**

## Scaling In

Don't deploy your full position at once. Scale in:

| Entry | % of Position | When |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **First** | 30-50% | Initial signal |
| **Second** | 30-40% | Confirmation |
| **Third** | 20-30% | Strength |

**Why scale?**
- Reduces risk of bad entry
- Averages your cost basis
- Lets you react to new information

---

## When to Size Down

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Late to the move | Use 50% of normal size |
| Conflicting signals | Use 50% of normal size |
| High VIX (>25) | Use 50-75% of normal size |
| Multiple open positions | Leave room for new setups |

---

## Position Limits

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Max 3-4 positions** | Focus > diversification |
| **Max 50% in one position** | Never bet the farm |
| **Always have cash** | Opportunities come unexpectedly |

---

## Example: Full Workflow

> **Scenario:**
> - Portfolio: $50,000
> - Mode: Green (25% cap = $12,500 max)
> - Setup: TSLA at Gamma Strike, HIRO positive
> - Conviction: High (75% of cap)
> 
> **Calculation:**
> - Max position: $12,500 × 0.75 = $9,375
> 
> **Scaling plan:**
> - Entry 1: $3,750 (40%) at $420
> - Entry 2: $3,000 (32%) on pullback hold
> - Entry 3: $2,625 (28%) on breakout confirm

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Going all-in on first entry | Scale in 3 entries |
| Exceeding mode cap | Hard rule, no exceptions |
| Same size every trade | Adjust for conviction |
| No cash reserve | Keep 25-50% available |

---

## Key Takeaways

| Principle | Remember |
|-----------|----------|
| **Mode is law** | Never exceed the cap |
| **Conviction matters** | High conviction = bigger size |
| **Scale in** | 3 entries beat 1 |
| **Leave room** | Cash is a position |

---

*Size to survive. The best trade is the one you can hold.*
