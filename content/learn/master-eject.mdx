## What Is the Master Eject?

The **Master Eject** is a price level where you exit all positions. No hesitation. No hoping for a bounce. Just out.

It's your **circuit breaker** for capital protection.

---

## Why It Exists

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Limits drawdowns** | Small losses stay small |
| **Removes emotion** | Decision is pre-made |
| **Preserves capital** | Live to trade another day |
| **Signals regime change** | If broken, structure has failed |

---

## How It's Set

The Master Eject is placed below key support levels:

| Consideration | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Below Put Wall | Put Wall at $400 → Master Eject at $390 |
| Below weekly EMA support | 21 EMA at $395 → Master Eject at $390 |
| Technical structure | Major support at $395 → Master Eject at $388 |

Typically **2-5% below** the lowest key support level.

---

## What To Do When It Triggers

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Exit immediately** — don't wait for confirmation |
| 2 | **Close all TSLA positions** — calls, shares, whatever |
| 3 | **Go to cash** — sit on hands |
| 4 | **Wait for new report** — let the system recalibrate |

---

## Master Eject vs Stop Loss

| Feature | Master Eject | Regular Stop |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Scope** | All positions | Single position |
| **Purpose** | Capital protection | Trade management |
| **Flexibility** | None — it's absolute | Can be adjusted |
| **Emotion** | Pre-decided | Often moved |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "It'll bounce" | It might not — and you can't afford to find out |
| Moving the eject lower | Defeats the purpose |
| Waiting for confirmation | You already have it — price broke |
| Re-entering same day | Wait for structure to rebuild |

---

## The Hard Truth

The Master Eject will sometimes trigger **right before a reversal**. That's okay.

| Outcome | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Eject triggers, price reverses | You missed a bounce — acceptable |
| Eject triggers, price keeps falling | You saved your capital — critical |

The asymmetry is in your favor: **small misses vs. catastrophic losses**.

---

## Key Takeaway

The Master Eject isn't about being right. It's about **staying solvent**. Every great trader has a point where they simply get out.

---

*Capital preservation beats being right. The Master Eject keeps you in the game.*
