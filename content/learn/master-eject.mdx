## What Is the Master Eject?

The Master Eject is **not a single price level** where you panic-sell everything. It's an **escalating defense zone** anchored at the Weekly 21 EMA, with graduated responses as price moves lower.

**The old way:** Price hits level → sell everything → go to cash.

**The v4.0 way:** Price enters zone → cut leverage → assess context → trim if structure breaks → hold core for recovery.

---

## The Escalating Defense Zone

| Level | What It Means | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Weekly 21 EMA** | Structure damage — weekly trend support lost | Cut ALL leverage (TSLL, options). Non-negotiable. |
| **Between W21 and Put Wall** | Contested territory — watch HIRO and gamma | Hold TSLA shares. No new buys until support confirms. Assess context. |
| **Put Wall / Gamma Strike** | Institutional support floor | If HIRO positive + level holding: nibble TSLA shares with available cash |
| **Below Put Wall** | Structure broken, no gamma floor | Trim TSLA to 50%. 200 SMA Override takes over. |

## Why Partial Exit, Not Full Liquidation?

The W21 EMA breaking signals **structure damage**, but it doesn't mean the bull thesis is dead.

| Outcome | What You Did | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| W21 breaks, bounces back | Cut leverage, held shares | Participated in recovery with core position |
| W21 breaks, falls to Put Wall | Cut leverage, held shares, nibbled support | Built position at better prices |
| W21 breaks, Put Wall breaks | Cut leverage, trimmed to 50% | Protected capital while keeping exposure |
| Crashes to 200 SMA | Trimmed to 50%, deployed via Override | Caught generational buying opportunity |

**The asymmetry:** Cutting leverage protects you from the worst outcomes. Holding 50% core keeps you positioned for recovery. You don't need to be all-in or all-out.

---

## The Two-Close Rule

Master Eject triggers require **two consecutive daily closes** below the Weekly 21 EMA.

**Why?**
- Single-day wicks below W21 are common
- Waiting for confirmation prevents whipsaws
- If it closes below twice, structure is actually breaking

**Exception:** You still cut leverage on the **first** close below W21. The two-close rule applies to trimming TSLA to 50%.

---

## What To Do At Each Level

### Level 1: W21 EMA Breaks (First Close)

**Immediate action:**
1. Sell ALL leverage positions (TSLL, options)
2. Set alert for second close below W21
3. Continue holding TSLA shares

**Why cut leverage first?** Leveraged products amplify losses. In a breakdown, they can go to zero. Shares can recover; TSLL during a crash cannot.

### Level 2: W21 EMA Confirms (Second Close)

**If second consecutive close below W21:**
1. Trim TSLA to 50% of portfolio
2. Enter EJECTED state (0% daily cap)
3. Watch for Put Wall / Gamma Strike support
4. 200 SMA Override now active for oversold deployment

### Level 3: Put Wall / Gamma Strike Zone

**If price reaches institutional support with positive HIRO:**
- This is your **buy zone** — shares only, no leverage
- Nibble with available cash
- Require HIRO positive + level holding

**If HIRO negative and level breaking:**
- Do NOT buy
- Wait for flush to complete
- Watch for 200 SMA Override triggers

### Level 4: Below Put Wall

**If Put Wall breaks:**
1. Trim remaining TSLA to 50% if not already done
2. 200 SMA Override is your only deployment method
3. Tier 1: 20% below 200 SMA = 10% of portfolio in shares
4. Tier 2: 30% below 200 SMA = 25% (60% TSLA / 40% TSLL)
5. Tier 3: 40% below 200 SMA = 40% (40% TSLA / 60% TSLL)

## Context Matters: Using HIRO

The same price level means different things with different HIRO readings:

| HIRO | Price at Put Wall | Action |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Strongly positive (+50%+ of range) | Institutional buying, support likely | Nibble shares |
| Neutral (around 0) | Unclear, wait for direction | Hold, no action |
| Strongly negative (-50%+ of range) | Institutions selling, breakdown likely | Do not buy, prepare to trim |

**Key insight:** HIRO flipping positive after a selloff often signals capitulation is complete and the floor is in.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll sell everything at W21" | Partial exit protects you while keeping recovery exposure |
| "I'll hold through it" | Cutting leverage is non-negotiable — it can go to zero |
| "One close below = sell" | Wait for two closes to confirm structure break |
| "Put Wall means buy" | Only if HIRO is positive — context matters |
| "200 SMA is too far" | It's your generational buying opportunity |

---

## Key Takeaway

Master Eject isn't about panic — it's about **graduated defense**. Cut leverage immediately. Trim shares on confirmation. Use context (HIRO, gamma) to decide when the floor is in. The goal is to survive the drawdown while staying positioned for recovery.

*Capital preservation beats being right. But you don't have to choose — you can protect AND participate.*
