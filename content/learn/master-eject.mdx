## What Kill Leverage Is (and Isn't)

Kill Leverage is **not full liquidation**. It is a **graduated defense process** designed to protect capital while preserving a core recovery position.

---

## Core Trigger Sequence

### 1) First Close Below Weekly 21 EMA
- Cut **all leverage** immediately (TSLL, calls, other leveraged risk)
- Keep core shares for now

### 2) Second Consecutive Close Below Weekly 21 EMA
- Trim TSLA exposure to **50% core hold**
- Enter **EJECTED** state

This two-step design avoids one-day whipsaw exits while still forcing immediate leverage risk removal.

---

## Context Layer: Put Wall Zone

After EJECTED transition:
- If price reaches Put Wall zone and **HIRO is positive** with level holding, small share nibbles are allowed.
- If price loses Put Wall support, the **200 SMA Override** becomes the primary deployment framework.

## 200 SMA Override Tiers (Verified)

| Tier | Drawdown vs 200 SMA | Portfolio Allocation | Mix |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-----|
| Tier 1 | -20% | 10% in shares | 100% TSLA |
| Tier 2 | -30% | 25% | 60% TSLA / 40% TSLL |
| Tier 3 | -40% | 40% | 40% TSLA / 60% TSLL |

These are oversold override rules — separate from normal mode buying.

## Max Invested Context During Downgrades

Before EJECTED, max invested caps are tiered guidance:

| Transition | Guidance |
|------------|----------|
| GREEN → YELLOW | Usually no forced reduction required |
| YELLOW → ORANGE | Soft reduction recommendation if overexposed |
| ORANGE → RED | Strong suggestion to work toward defensive sizing |
| Any → EJECTED | Mandatory: remove leverage and trim to 50% core |

Kill Leverage is where guidance becomes hard defense protocol.

## Key Takeaway

Kill Leverage is a risk circuit breaker:
1. Remove leverage on first structural break
2. Confirm break before cutting core to 50%
3. Use Put Wall + HIRO context for controlled re-entry
4. Fall back to 200 SMA Override when structure worsens
