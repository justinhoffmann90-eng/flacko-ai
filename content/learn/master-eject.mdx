## What is a Master Eject?

A Master Eject is a **pre-defined price level** where you reduce exposure significantly — regardless of your thesis, regardless of your feelings.

It's not a stop loss on a single trade. It's a portfolio-wide circuit breaker that says: "Structure has failed. Protect capital."

      <div className="text-zinc-300 mb-3">If TSLA closes below this level, reduce long exposure by 50% minimum. No exceptions. No "let me wait and see."</div>
      <div className="text-sm text-zinc-500">This level marks complete structural failure. Dealer support is gone. The trend has broken.</div>

## Why Master Ejects exist

Every trader has experienced this:

- "It'll bounce here"
- "This is oversold"
- "I'll just hold a bit longer"

Then 10% becomes 20% becomes 40%. By the time you act, the damage is catastrophic.

Master Ejects **remove the decision from emotional you**. The level is set in advance. When it hits, you act. Period.

## How Master Ejects are set

The Master Eject isn't arbitrary. It's placed at a level where:

1. **All key support has failed** — Put Wall, Gamma Strike, Hedge Wall all breached
2. **Trend structure is broken** — Below key EMAs with momentum
3. **Dealer positioning is hostile** — No institutional support below

It's the "even if everything else looks okay, this level means trouble" price.

## What to do when Master Eject triggers

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Reduce long exposure by 50%+** — Sell half your TSLA position at minimum
2. **Close leveraged positions** — Options, margin calls get ugly fast below this level
3. **Move to cash or hedges** — Capital preservation is now the only goal
4. **Do NOT buy the dip** — The structure is broken. Wait for it to repair.

**What comes next:**

- Wait for price to reclaim key levels before re-entering
- Watch for a new base to form
- Let the daily report tell you when conditions improve

## The psychology of Master Ejects

Here's the hard truth: **you will not want to sell.**

Your brain will say:
- "It's oversold"
- "It'll bounce tomorrow"
- "I can't sell at the lows"

This is why the level is set in advance. You made the decision with a clear head. Now you just execute.

The traders who survive drawdowns aren't smarter. They just have rules they actually follow.

## Master Eject ≠ Permanent exit

Triggering a Master Eject doesn't mean you're done with TSLA forever. It means:

- You've protected capital during structural failure
- You'll re-enter when structure repairs
- You live to trade another day with your account intact

The best traders don't avoid all losses. They avoid catastrophic losses.
