## What Is the Hedge Wall?

The **Hedge Wall** marks where significant institutional hedging creates resistance. Unlike the Call Wall (open interest), the Hedge Wall reflects **active hedging flow**.

## Hedge Wall vs Call Wall

| Level | Based On | Behavior |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Call Wall** | Open interest | Pulls price up (magnet) |
| **Hedge Wall** | Active flow | Hard ceiling (resistance) |

**Think of it this way:**
- Call Wall = where people *have* calls
- Hedge Wall = where institutions *are actively hedging*
