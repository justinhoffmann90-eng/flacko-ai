## What is the Hedge Wall?

The **Hedge Wall** is a price level where significant institutional hedging activity creates resistance. Unlike the Call Wall (based on open interest), the Hedge Wall reflects **active hedging flow**.

## Why It Matters

Large institutions hedge their portfolios at specific levels. When price approaches the Hedge Wall:
- Selling pressure increases as hedges are placed
- Price often stalls or reverses
- Breaking through requires significant buying power

## Key Behaviors

- **Approaching the Hedge Wall**: Expect resistance, momentum often fades
- **At the Hedge Wall**: High probability reversal zone
- **Above the Hedge Wall**: If broken, can signal a shift in institutional positioning

## How to Use It

1. **Profit target**: Take profits as price approaches the Hedge Wall
2. **Fade zone**: Consider short-term shorts if momentum is weak
3. **Breakout watch**: A clean break with volume can signal trend continuation

## Hedge Wall vs Call Wall

| Level | Based On | Behavior |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Call Wall | Open interest | Upside magnet |
| Hedge Wall | Active flow | Hard ceiling |

The Call Wall pulls price up. The Hedge Wall stops it.
