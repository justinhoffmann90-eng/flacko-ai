## What Is the Slow Zone?

The **Slow Zone** is a price region where momentum has stalled. Neither bulls nor bears are in control. It's a waiting game.

---

## Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Low directional conviction** | No clear trend |
| **Compressed price action** | Tight daily ranges |
| **Mixed signals** | Conflicting indicators |
| **Dealer neutrality** | Gamma balanced, no dominant flow |

---

## How to Identify It

| Indicator | Slow Zone Signal |
|-----------|------------------|
| **HIRO** | Oscillating around 0, no sustained direction |
| **Volume** | Below average, declining |
| **EMAs** | Price chopping around 9/13, no clean trend |
| **Range** | Daily moves <2% repeatedly |
| **Gamma** | Near flip point, balanced positioning |

---

## Why It Happens

| Cause | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Waiting for catalyst** | Earnings, Fed, macro event |
| **Exhaustion** | After a big move, market rests |
| **Indecision** | Buyers and sellers balanced |
| **Holiday/low liquidity** | Reduced participation |

---

## What To Do in the Slow Zone

### ✅ Do This
| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Reduce position size** | Less conviction = less risk |
| **Tighten ranges** | Fade extremes of the range |
| **Be patient** | Don't force trades |
| **Wait for breakout** | Let the market decide |

### ❌ Don't Do This
| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Trade full size** | Whipsaws will hurt |
| **Chase small moves** | They reverse quickly |
| **Expect follow-through** | Breakouts fail in Slow Zone |
| **Get frustrated** | Chop is part of the game |

---

## Slow Zone Trading Rules

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Half size max** | Even in Green mode, use 50% of cap |
| **Tight stops** | Cut losers fast |
| **Quick profits** | Take 50-70% of normal targets |
| **Watch for resolution** | Slow Zones end with fast moves |

---

## Exiting the Slow Zone

The Slow Zone breaks when:

| Signal | Direction |
|--------|-----------|
| HIRO sustains >+30% | Bullish breakout likely |
| HIRO sustains <-30% | Bearish breakdown likely |
| Volume spike (2x average) | Move incoming |
| Clean break above/below range | New trend starting |

---

## Example

> **Situation:**
> - TSLA: $415-$420 for 4 days
> - HIRO: -5% to +10% (oscillating)
> - Daily volume: -30% vs average
> - Mode: Yellow
> 
> **Read:** Slow Zone active
> 
> **Your plan:**
> - Max 7.5% deployment (half of Yellow cap)
> - Fade moves to $415 and $420
> - Wait for sustained HIRO direction
> - On breakout with volume, size up

---

## Key Takeaways

| Point | Remember |
|-------|----------|
| **Slow Zone = patience** | Don't force it |
| **Size down** | Half your normal size |
| **Fade the range** | Until it breaks |
| **Breakout = opportunity** | The resolution is tradeable |

*The Slow Zone tests your discipline. Winners wait for clarity.*
