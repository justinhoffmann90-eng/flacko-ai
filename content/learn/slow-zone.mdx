## What Is Slow Zone?

Slow Zone is a **mechanical position-sizing modifier**.

- **Trigger:** Price closes below **Daily 21 EMA × 0.98**
- **Resume:** Price reclaims Daily 21 EMA
- **Purpose:** Reduce buying speed when trend quality weakens

---

## Core Rule

In standard operation, Slow Zone halves your daily cap.  
But ORANGE and RED are special:

- **YELLOW:** 50% of normal cap
- **ORANGE/RED:** **25% of normal cap** (not 50%)

## Slow Zone Caps by Mode

| Mode | Normal Daily Cap | Slow Zone Daily Cap |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 30% (subscriber view 25%) | Inactive |
| 🟡 YELLOW (Improving) | 20% | Inactive |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 17.5% | 8.75% |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | **2.5%** |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | **1.25%** |

---

## Why ORANGE and RED Are Different

In ORANGE/RED, risk is already elevated. If Slow Zone also triggers, conditions are deteriorating fast.  
So the system cuts pace harder — to one-quarter of normal.

## Slow Zone vs Master Eject

| Feature | Slow Zone | Master Eject |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Anchor | Daily 21 EMA | Weekly 21 EMA |
| Trigger Type | D21 × 0.98 close breach | W21 close/confirm breach |
| Primary Effect | Reduce daily buy cap | Cut leverage, move to defense |
| Goal | Slow accumulation | Protect portfolio structure |

---

## Key Takeaway

Slow Zone is a pacing rule, not an opinion:
- YELLOW slows to half
- ORANGE/RED slow to one-quarter
- GREEN and YELLOW (Improving) ignore it

Use it exactly as written to avoid oversizing into weakening structure.
