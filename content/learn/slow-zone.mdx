## What is the Slow Zone?

The Slow Zone is a price region where **action should slow down**. Not because the trade is bad, but because the structure is unclear.

It's a built-in circuit breaker that says: "This area is messy. Wait for clarity."

## Why Slow Zones exist

Markets aren't always clear. Sometimes price gets stuck between levels where:

- Bulls and bears are fighting
- Dealers are hedging in both directions
- No clear trend has established

Trading aggressively in these zones is a coin flip. You're not trading structure — you're gambling.

## How to identify a Slow Zone

The daily report marks Slow Zones when:

1. **Price is between key levels** — no clear support/resistance nearby
2. **HIRO is neutral** — dealers aren't leaning either way
3. **Technical structure is messy** — no clean trend, choppy action
4. **Multiple scenarios equally likely** — no dominant path

      <div className="text-sm text-zinc-300">Price range: $415-$425. Structure unclear. Reduce new positions to nibbles only until price breaks above $425 or below $415 with conviction.</div>

## What to do in a Slow Zone

**1. Reduce size**
If you must trade, cut your normal size in half. Or more.

**2. Tighten stops**
Slow Zones are choppy. Wide stops get hunted.

**3. Wait for the break**
The best trade is often waiting for price to exit the Slow Zone. Let others get chopped up.

**4. Don't force it**
No setup in the Slow Zone? Good. Do nothing. That's the right call.

## Slow Zone vs Red Mode

These are different concepts:

| Slow Zone | Red Mode |
|-----------|----------|
| Structure is *unclear* | Structure is *clearly bad* |
| Wait for clarity | Trade defensively |
| Could break either way | Already broke down |
| Patience is the play | Capital preservation is the play |

You can be in Green mode and hit a Slow Zone (bullish environment, but price in no-man's-land).

You can be in Red mode outside a Slow Zone (bearish environment, but clear structure).

## The discipline of patience

The Slow Zone is a test. It asks: "Can you wait?"

Most traders can't. They see price moving and feel compelled to act. They get chopped up and frustrated.

The disciplined trader sees the Slow Zone and says: "Not yet. Let it resolve."

Then, when price breaks out with conviction, they're ready — with full size and clear structure.
