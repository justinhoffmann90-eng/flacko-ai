## What Is the Slow Zone?

The Slow Zone is a **mechanical sizing trigger** that halves your daily buy cap when price weakens. It's not a market condition you interpret — it's a specific rule that fires automatically.

**Trigger:** Price closes below Daily 21 EMA × 0.98 (2% below the D21)

**Effect:** Daily cap is halved

**Resume:** When price reclaims the Daily 21 EMA

---

## The Rule

| Condition | Your Daily Cap |
|-----------|---------------|
| Price above Daily 21 EMA | Normal cap per mode |
| Price 0-2% below Daily 21 EMA | Normal cap per mode |
| Price >2% below Daily 21 EMA | **Half** your normal cap |

**Example:**
- Mode: GREEN (30% daily cap)
- D21 EMA: $420
- Slow Zone trigger: $420 × 0.98 = $411.60
- TSLA closes at $408 (below $411.60)
- Your cap: 30% → **15%** while Slow Zone active

---

## Why It Exists

The Slow Zone creates a **graduated response** between normal operations and Master Eject.

| Without Slow Zone | With Slow Zone |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Full buying until W21 breaks | Slows you down as momentum fades |
| All-in or all-out | Graduated reduction |
| Miss early recoveries if you stop buying | Still accumulate, just slower |
| Binary decision | Continuous adjustment |

**The insight:** When price is 2%+ below the D21, momentum is weakening. You shouldn't be loading up aggressively — but you shouldn't stop buying entirely either. The Slow Zone finds the middle ground.

---

## When It's Inactive

The Slow Zone is **inactive** in two modes:

| Mode | Why Inactive |
|------|--------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | Strong momentum — brief dips below D21 are normal |
| 🟡 YELLOW (Improving) | Recovery underway — don't slow down accumulation |

In these modes, the trend is healthy enough that a dip below D21 is likely a buying opportunity, not a warning sign.

---

## ORANGE and RED: Double Reduction

In defensive modes, the Slow Zone stacks with already-reduced caps:

| Mode | Normal Cap | With Slow Zone |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | 5% |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | 2.5% |

**Why?** When you're already in a defensive mode AND price is 2%+ below D21, conditions are deteriorating fast. The double reduction keeps you from catching a falling knife.

## Slow Zone vs Master Eject

| | Slow Zone | Master Eject |
|--|-----------|--------------|
| **Anchor** | Daily 21 EMA | Weekly 21 EMA |
| **Trigger** | 2% below anchor | Close below anchor |
| **Effect** | Halve daily cap | Cut leverage, trim shares |
| **Purpose** | Slow accumulation | Protect capital |
| **Recovery** | Reclaim D21 | Reclaim W21 + rebuild structure |

**Think of it this way:**
- Slow Zone = yellow light, slow down
- Master Eject = red light, stop and reassess

---

## How to Use It

### When Slow Zone Activates

1. **Check the calculation:** D21 × 0.98 = your trigger level
2. **Halve your planned deployment:** If you were going to buy $10k, buy $5k
3. **Still buy at key levels:** Slow Zone doesn't mean stop — it means slower
4. **Watch for D21 reclaim:** That's your signal to resume normal cap

### What NOT to Do

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| Stop buying entirely | You'll miss the early recovery |
| Ignore the Slow Zone | You'll oversize into weakness |
| Wait for perfect entry | Slow accumulation beats timing |
| Fight the rule | The rule exists because it works |

## Example

**Setup:**
- Mode: 🟡 YELLOW (17.5% daily cap)
- D21 EMA: $425
- Slow Zone trigger: $425 × 0.98 = $416.50
- Portfolio: $100,000 with $50,000 cash

**Monday:** TSLA at $430
- Slow Zone: Inactive
- Daily cap: $50,000 × 17.5% = $8,750

**Tuesday:** TSLA drops to $415 (below $416.50)
- Slow Zone: **Active**
- Daily cap: $8,750 ÷ 2 = **$4,375**

**Wednesday:** TSLA at $412
- Slow Zone: Still active
- Continue with $4,375 cap

**Thursday:** TSLA rallies to $427 (above D21)
- Slow Zone: Deactivated
- Daily cap: Back to $8,750

## Key Takeaway

The Slow Zone is simple: **When price is 2%+ below the Daily 21 EMA, halve your daily cap.**

It's not about reading the market. It's not about your opinion. It's a mechanical rule that protects you automatically.

*Slow Zone = slow down, not stop. Keep accumulating, just be patient.*
