## What is HIRO?

**HIRO** (Hedging Impact Real-time Oscillator) shows **real-time dealer hedging pressure**. It tells you whether options flow is pushing price up or down.

## Reading HIRO

| HIRO Reading | Meaning | Typical Action |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| **Strong positive** (+50% or more) | Heavy call buying → dealers buying shares | Bullish pressure, support likely |
| **Moderate positive** (+10% to +50%) | Slight bullish bias | Lean bullish, watch for confirmation |
| **Neutral** (-10% to +10%) | Balanced flow | No directional signal |
| **Moderate negative** (-10% to -50%) | Slight bearish bias | Lean bearish, watch for confirmation |
| **Strong negative** (-50% or more) | Heavy put buying → dealers selling shares | Bearish pressure, resistance likely |

---

## HIRO vs Price Action

| HIRO | Price | Signal |
|------|-------|--------|
| ↑ Rising | ↑ Rising | **Confirmation** — trend supported |
| ↑ Rising | ↓ Falling | **Divergence** — potential reversal up |
| ↓ Falling | ↓ Falling | **Confirmation** — downtrend supported |
| ↓ Falling | ↑ Rising | **Divergence** — potential reversal down |

**Divergences are powerful signals.** If HIRO is positive but price is falling, dealers are buying — a bounce may be coming.

---

## When to Check HIRO

| Situation | Why Check |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Price at key level** | Confirm whether hedging supports a bounce/rejection |
| **Breakout attempt** | Is flow supporting the move? |
| **Divergence spotted** | HIRO opposite price direction = reversal setup |
| **Before entering** | Confirm your bias with hedging flow |

## HIRO + Gamma Regime

|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Positive gamma** | Supports range high | Supports range low |
| **Negative gamma** | Can fuel rallies | Can fuel selloffs |

In negative gamma, HIRO readings are **amplified** — a strong negative HIRO can accelerate a selloff.
