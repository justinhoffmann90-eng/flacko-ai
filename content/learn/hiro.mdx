## What is HIRO?

**HIRO** (Hedging Impact Real-time Overlay) tracks estimated hedging flows from dealers based on options transactions during the trading day. It measures the dollar amount of stock that dealers need to buy or sell to hedge their options book as new trades come in.

- **Positive HIRO** = dealers are net buying the underlying to hedge (bullish pressure)
- **Negative HIRO** = dealers are net selling the underlying to hedge (bearish pressure)
- **Resets to zero at market open** -- each day's reading is cumulative intraday flow, not a running total across days

## SpotGamma's 5-Step HIRO Checklist

### Step 1: Select Your Ticker
Type the ticker (TSLA) in the search field. For new ideas, check the trending list or Scanners page.

### Step 2: Watch HIRO Near Call Wall or Put Wall
- **Call Wall** = resistance line. If HIRO flattens near Call Wall, it marks a potential top.
- **Put Wall** = support line. If HIRO flattens near Put Wall, it marks a potential bottom.

### Step 3: Check If Flows Are Short-Term or Longer-Dated
- Toggle the **Next Expiry** flow to assess short-term options buying.
- **Primarily next expiry flows** = price movement is less stable, prone to reversal.
- **Primarily longer-dated flows** = higher likelihood of stable price action.

### Step 4: Check for HIRO Flow Alerts
- Flow alerts indicate outsized options activity (a net change in delta -- hedging pressure switching from positive to negative or vice versa).
- **When a flow alert fires, wait for flows to "shut off" and look for reversals.**

### Step 5: Check the HIRO Signal Gauge (Stock Screener)
- The gray background = entire 30-day range.
- Coloration shows where buying/selling pressure has been for the last 5 days.
- **Bolded circle toward either end** = heightened buying or selling pressure vs. the last 30 days.

## HIRO Trading Strategies (SpotGamma)

### Basic: Reversion from HIRO Flows
After a HIRO flow alert fires, watch if HIRO's momentum continues or flatlines/reverses.
- **Flow correlated with price increase, then HIRO flatlines:** Consider bearish positions
- **Flow correlated with price decrease, then HIRO flatlines:** Consider bullish positions

**Key stat:** After flow alerts shut off, the stock reverts back in the previous direction **70% of the time**.

**Pro tip:** Check the difference between short-dated and longer-dated flows using the Next Expiry toggle. Major long-term flows are more impactful in the future, while 0DTE/next expiry flows generate larger current dealer hedging impact.

### Intermediate: Selling Premium at Wall Reversions
HIRO flatlines at a SpotGamma resistance or support level:
- **Flow with price increase near Call Wall:** Sell call spreads above Call Wall
- **Flow with price decrease near Put Wall:** Sell put spreads below Put Wall

### Advanced: Buy ITM Spreads After Sharp HIRO Moves
HIRO alert fires on a stock strongly under influence of options. Reversal expected once flow shuts off:
- **Price risen sharply:** Buy in-the-money put spread
- **Price dropped sharply:** Buy in-the-money call spread

## How Flacko AI Uses HIRO

We use HIRO as a **conviction modifier** and **intraday timing tool**, not for 0DTE spread trading. Two reads:

### Level-Based Read (Conviction Adjustment)
Where today's closing HIRO value sits in the 30-day range:
- **Upper quartile** (e.g., +800M in a -1.1B to +1.4B range) = bullish conviction boost
- **Lower quartile** (e.g., -700M) = bearish conviction, reduce sizing
- **Middle** = neutral, no adjustment

### Direction-Based Read (Intraday Timing)
How HIRO is trending during the session:
- **HIRO trending up** = dealers buying into strength, trim later in day
- **HIRO trending down** = dealers selling into weakness, nibble later in day
- **HIRO flat** = no directional bias

### The 70% Reversion + BX-Trender Connection
The 70% reversion after flow alerts aligns with our framework: when HIRO reaches extremes and reverses, it often coincides with BX-Trender inflection points.
- **Extreme negative HIRO + BX-Trender HL transition** = high-conviction buy setup
- **Extreme positive HIRO + BX-Trender LH transition** = trim signal

## HIRO + Price Divergences

| HIRO | Price | Signal |
|------|-------|--------|
| Rising | Rising | **Confirmation** -- trend supported |
| Rising | Falling | **Divergence** -- potential reversal up |
| Falling | Falling | **Confirmation** -- downtrend supported |
| Falling | Rising | **Divergence** -- potential reversal down |

**Divergences are powerful signals.** If HIRO is positive but price is falling, dealers are buying -- a bounce may be coming.

---

## Staleness Rule

HIRO resets daily and accumulates during the session. A reading captured more than 2 hours before close is stale and should not be used for conviction reads. State the capture time and value, then say "no conviction read" -- do not speculate about what HIRO "likely" did after capture.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **HIRO shows real-time dealer hedging flow** -- not lagging
- **Positive = bullish pressure** (dealers buying)
- **Negative = bearish pressure** (dealers selling)
- **Resets to zero daily** -- each day is independent
- **70% reversion after flow alerts** -- the key stat to remember
- **Short-dated vs longer-dated flows matter** -- next expiry flows are less stable
- **Divergences between HIRO and price** are high-quality signals
- **Staleness matters** -- only use close-to-close readings for conviction
