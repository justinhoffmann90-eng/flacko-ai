## Most alerts are noise

Price moved 2%. Your phone buzzes. You check. Nothing to do. Repeat 50 times a day.

This is why most traders turn alerts off. They're trained to ignore them.

## Structure-based alerts are different

Flacko AI alerts trigger when **key levels are tested** — the prices where actual decisions need to be made.

Not when price moved. When price moved *to a level that matters*.

## When you get alerted

- **Key level approach**: Price is nearing Put Wall, Call Wall, Gamma Strike, or Hedge Wall
- **Level break**: A key level was breached — momentum may accelerate
- **Mode change**: Market conditions shifted, adjust your risk sizing

Each alert comes with context:
- What level was hit
- What it means
- What action to consider

## How to use alerts

**1. Don't react instantly.** An alert is information, not a command. Take 30 seconds to assess.

**2. Check the mode.** Your response depends on current risk regime. Orange mode alert ≠ green mode alert.

**3. Reference the report.** Each alert connects back to the daily report's scenarios. You've already thought through this.

**4. Execute your plan.** The point of preparation is that when the alert hits, you already know what to do.

## What alerts look like

> 🔔 **TSLA hit $420 Hedge Wall**  
> This is today's resistance level. Watch for rejection or break.  
> Mode: 🟠 Orange | Cap: 10%

> 🔔 **TSLA broke below $400 Put Wall**  
> Downside support lost. Next level: $385.  
> Mode: 🔴 Red | Cap: 5%

## Alerts + Discord

All alerts post to the Flacko AI Discord as well. You can see what triggered in real-time and discuss with the gang.
