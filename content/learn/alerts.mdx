## What an Alert Includes

Each alert contains actionable context, not just a price ping.

| Field | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Level + label | The structural level that triggered |
| Mode context | Current mode color, daily cap, and guidance |
| Suggested action | Short execution prompt |
| Reason | Why that level matters in current structure |

Alerts are delivered via **email + Discord**.

---

## Mode Context in Alerts

| Mode | Simplified Daily Cap | Typical Posture |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 25% | Offensive but structured |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 15% | Balanced risk |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% | Defensive accumulation |
| 🔴 RED | 5% | Capital preservation first |

The alert message references this context so the same level is interpreted differently by mode.

## Alert Types and Structural Reasons

| Alert Type | Why It Matters | Typical Response |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Gamma Strike** | Above strike often implies more stable/positive gamma behavior; below can increase instability | Watch for reclaim/hold or rejection |
| **Call Wall** | Dealer positioning can cap upside near this zone | Trim into strength / avoid chasing |
| **Put Wall** | Key downside support where flows can stabilize | Look for hold-and-bounce confirmation |
| **Hedge Wall** | Often acts as resistance/supply zone | Reduce risk or wait for clean break |
| **Weekly EMA Level** | Regime structure marker (trend health) | Reassess mode posture |
| **Slow Zone Trigger** | Price closed below D21 × 0.98, buy pace must drop | Apply reduced daily cap immediately |

---

## Slow Zone Alert Behavior

Slow Zone alerts explicitly state the cap adjustment:

| Mode | Slow Zone Cap |
|------|---------------|
| YELLOW | 8.75% |
| ORANGE | 2.5% |
| RED | 1.25% |

(ORANGE/RED use 25% of normal cap, not 50%.)

## Execution Checklist After Any Alert

1. Confirm mode and cap context in the alert
2. Check whether level is holding or breaking
3. Apply sizing rules (daily cap + max invested)
4. Execute only if plan and context align

## Key Takeaway

Alerts are not generic notifications. They combine **level + mode + reasoning + action** so you can execute quickly with the right risk posture.
