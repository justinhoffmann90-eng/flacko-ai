## What Are Alerts?

Alerts notify you when price hits a **key level**. Each alert includes:

| Component | What It Tells You |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Level** | The price that triggered (e.g., $420) |
| **Name** | What the level is (e.g., Gamma Strike) |
| **Action** | What to consider doing |
| **Context** | Why this level matters |

---

## Alert Flow

```
Price hits level → Alert fires → You see notification → Execute your plan
```

---

## Types of Levels

| Level | Typical Action | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Gamma Strike** | Watch for reaction | Highest gamma zone — price often reverses here |
| **Call Wall** | Consider taking profits | Upside resistance from dealer hedging |
| **Put Wall** | Look for bounce | Downside support from dealer hedging |
| **Hedge Wall** | Expect resistance | Institutional hedging ceiling |
| **Weekly EMA** | Trend confirmation | Break = potential trend change |

---

## What To Do When Alert Fires

### Step 1: Confirm the Mode
Is the alert aligned with today's mode?

| Mode | Alert Action |
|------|--------------|
| 🟢 GREEN | Full action per the alert |
| 🟡 YELLOW | Half-size or wait for confirmation |
| 🟠 ORANGE | Small position only |
| 🔴 RED | Watch, don't chase |

### Step 2: Check Price Action
- Is price holding the level or breaking through?
- What's the volume like?
- Any divergence with HIRO?

### Step 3: Execute
- Use the suggested action as a **guide**, not a rule
- Size according to your mode cap
- Set your stop

## Alert Example

> **🔔 TSLA hit Gamma Strike at $415**
> 
> **Action:** "Add 10% of cap — testing key support"
> 
> **Your move:**
> - Mode is Yellow (15% cap)
> - 10% of 15% = 1.5% of portfolio
> - Watch for bounce confirmation before entry

---

## Key Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Don't chase** | If you miss the level by 2%+, wait for next setup |
| **Size by mode** | Alert + Green mode ≠ go all-in |
| **Have a stop** | Every position needs an exit plan |

*Alerts are triggers, not commands. Your job is to execute with discipline.*
