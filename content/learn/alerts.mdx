## What an alert means

An alert triggers when price **hits a key level** from the daily report. It’s a signal that **decision time** is near — not an instruction to blindly enter.

## Alert flow (simple version)

1. Daily report publishes with levels + mode
2. Alert system monitors price in real time
3. When price hits a level → **Discord + email alert** fires
4. You respond based on **mode + scenario + posture**

## How to respond

- **Check the mode.** It defines your max size and risk posture.
- **Read the reason.** Each alert includes context for why the level matters.
- **Look for confirmation.** Price action at the level is the trigger — not the alert itself.

## Discord vs. Email

- **Discord** is fastest for real‑time action.
- **Email** is the backup if you’re away from Discord.

Alerts are there to **focus your attention**, not to replace your judgment.
