## What Are Modes?

Modes are your **daily risk dial**. Before you trade, check the mode — it tells you how much capital you can deploy.

---

## The Four Modes

| Mode | Daily Cap | When It's Set | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | Up to 25% | Favorable conditions | Full send — market structure supports aggressive positioning |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | 15% or less | Mixed signals | Proceed with caution — be selective, wait for cleaner setups |
| 🟠 **ORANGE** | 10% or less | Elevated risk | High caution — only high-conviction plays |
| 🔴 **RED** | 5% or less | Defensive | Protect capital — nibbles only, if anything |

---

## How Modes Are Set

The daily report sets the mode based on:

| Factor | What We Look At |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Gamma positioning** | Are dealers in positive or negative gamma? |
| **Key levels** | Where are Call Wall, Put Wall, Gamma Strike? |
| **Technical structure** | Weekly EMAs, trend direction |
| **Volatility** | VIX levels, expected move |

## How to Use Modes

### ✅ Do This
- Check the mode **before the open**
- Size positions **within your cap**
- Respect mode changes mid-day if noted

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Ignore the mode because "you have conviction"
- Exceed your daily cap
- Trade aggressively in Red mode

## Example

> **Today's Mode: 🟡 YELLOW (15% cap)**
> 
> You have a $100,000 portfolio.
> Maximum deployment today = $15,000.
> 
> If you want to take 2 positions, each should be ~$7,500 or less.

## Key Takeaway

The mode isn't a suggestion — it's a **risk management rule**. Green doesn't mean "buy everything." Red doesn't mean "don't trade." It means **size accordingly**.

*Your mode is set every morning in the Daily Report. Check it first.*
