## The Six Modes

Modes are your **daily risk dial**. Before you trade, check the mode first — it tells you how much you can deploy, how much you can hold, and how aggressively you should trim.

| Mode | Daily Buy Cap | Max Invested Cap | Trim Cap | Slow Zone Effect |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------|------------------|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | 30% rulebook (subscriber view: **up to 25%**) | 85% | 10% per level | Inactive |
| 🟡 **YELLOW (Improving)** | 20% | 70% | **15%** | Inactive |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | 17.5% | 60% | 20% | Halves cap to 8.75% |
| 🟠 **ORANGE** | 10% | 40% | 25% | Reduces to 2.5% |
| 🔴 **RED** | 5% | 20% | 30% | Reduces to 1.25% |
| ⬛ **EJECTED** | 0% (oversold override only) | 50% core hold | N/A | N/A |

> **Subscriber simplification:** Daily reports use simplified caps for pace and consistency (GREEN 25%, YELLOW 15%, ORANGE 10%, RED 5%).

## Important Label Notes

- **YELLOW (Improving)** is a valid documented state.
- **ORANGE (Improving)** is also valid and can appear when **Tier 1 (Weekly) is LL** and **Tier 2 (Daily) is HL**.

These improving labels mean internals are stabilizing, even if the broader structure is still defensive.

## Understanding the Caps

### Daily Buy Cap
How much of your **available cash** you can deploy in one day.

### Max Invested Cap
The maximum share of your **total portfolio** that can be in TSLA exposure for that mode.

### Trim Cap
How much of your **remaining position** to trim at each T-level.

## Slow Zone Modifier

**Trigger:** Price closes below **Daily 21 EMA × 0.98**  
**Resume:** When price reclaims the Daily 21 EMA

| Mode Group | Slow Zone Impact |
|-----------|------------------|
| GREEN, YELLOW (Improving) | Inactive |
| YELLOW | Halves daily cap |
| ORANGE, RED | Reduces to **25% of normal cap** (not 50%) |

**Examples:**
- YELLOW: 17.5% → 8.75%
- ORANGE: 10% → 2.5%
- RED: 5% → 1.25%

## EJECTED Is a Defense State, Not Full Liquidation

When Weekly 21 EMA breaks and confirms:
1. Cut all leverage first
2. Trim TSLA to 50%
3. Keep core exposure
4. Only add through oversold override rules

This is graduated defense, not panic liquidation.

## Key Takeaway

Mode is not commentary — it's your **position-sizing rule set** for the day.  
Start with the mode, then apply daily cap, max invested cap, trim cap, and Slow Zone exactly.
