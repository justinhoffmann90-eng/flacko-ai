## The Five Modes

Modes are your **daily risk dial**. Before you trade, check the mode — it tells you how much capital you can deploy and how much you can hold.

| Mode | Daily Cap | Max Invested | Trim Cap | Posture |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | 30% | 85% | 10% | Full send — all timeframes aligned bullish |
| 🟡 **YELLOW (Improving)** | 20% | 70% | 20% | Daily leading weekly in recovery — meaningful accumulation |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | 17.5% | 60% | 20% | Warning signs present — controlled accumulation at key levels |
| 🟠 **ORANGE** | 10% | 40% | 25% | Multiple warnings — small nibbles only at key support |
| 🔴 **RED** | 5% | 20% | 30% | Breakdown confirmed — nibbles at extreme support only |
| ⬛ **EJECTED** | 0%* | 50% core | N/A | Below W21 for 2 closes — hold core, oversold override only |

*EJECTED mode allows deployment only via the 200 SMA Oversold Override.

## Understanding the Caps

### Daily Cap
How much of your **available cash** you can deploy in a single day.

**Example:** GREEN mode with $100,000 cash = $30,000 max deployment today.

**Why it matters:** Caps force you to spread entries over multiple days. In YELLOW, you need 5-6 days to reach max invested. This protects you from going all-in before a correction deepens.

### Max Invested
The maximum percentage of your portfolio that should be in TSLA positions.

**Example:** ORANGE mode = 40% max invested. If you have $200,000, max $80,000 in TSLA.

**Why it matters:** Even if you have cash and daily cap available, you shouldn't exceed your max invested limit for the current mode. This prevents overexposure when conditions are deteriorating.

### Trim Cap
How much of your **remaining position** to trim at each resistance level.

**Example:** ORANGE mode = 25% trim cap. If you hold $40,000 in TSLA and hit T1, trim $10,000.

**Why it matters:** In defensive modes, bounces are suspect. Higher trim caps help you lock in gains faster. In GREEN, you let winners run with smaller trims.

## YELLOW Improving vs Standard YELLOW

**YELLOW (Improving)** is a submode that triggers when the Daily BX-Trender is 2+ stages ahead of Weekly in a recovery pattern.

| Submode | Trigger | Daily Cap | Why |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----|
| YELLOW (Improving) | Daily green while Weekly still red | 20% | Recovery underway, accumulate meaningfully |
| YELLOW (Standard) | Warning signs, mixed structure | 17.5% | Uncertain, spread entries more |

**Key insight:** YELLOW Improving lets you build positions faster during early recoveries, while standard YELLOW keeps you cautious during deterioration.

## The EJECTED State

When price closes below the Weekly 21 EMA for **two consecutive days**, you enter the EJECTED state:

1. **Sell ALL leverage** (TSLL, options) immediately — non-negotiable
2. **Trim TSLA to 50%** of portfolio — hold core shares
3. **Daily cap drops to 0%** — no new buys via normal rules
4. **200 SMA Oversold Override activates** — only way to deploy in deeply oversold conditions

**Why partial exit, not full liquidation?** The W21 EMA break signals structure damage, but the bull thesis may still be intact. You protect capital by cutting leverage and trimming, but you keep 50% core exposure for the recovery.

## How Modes Are Set

The daily report sets the mode based on:

| Factor | What We Look At |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Weekly BX-Trender** | Tier 1 — the long-term trend health |
| **Daily BX-Trender** | Tier 2 — medium-term momentum |
| **EMA structure** | Price vs 9/13/21 EMAs on weekly and daily |
| **HIRO** | Dealer positioning and flow direction |
| **Gamma levels** | Call Wall, Put Wall, Gamma Strike positioning |

---

## The Slow Zone Modifier

When price closes below Daily 21 EMA × 0.98 (2% below), the **Slow Zone** activates:

- **Effect:** Halve your daily cap
- **Example:** GREEN 30% becomes 15% while Slow Zone active
- **Resume:** When price reclaims Daily 21 EMA
- **Exception:** Inactive in GREEN and YELLOW (Improving) modes

The Slow Zone creates a graduated response between normal accumulation and Master Eject. It slows you down without stopping you entirely.

## How to Use Modes

### ✅ Do This
- Check the mode **before the open**
- Size positions **within your daily cap**
- Respect **max invested** limits
- Use the **trim cap** at resistance levels
- Adjust for Slow Zone when active

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Ignore the mode because "you have conviction"
- Exceed your daily cap
- Exceed max invested for your mode
- Trade aggressively in RED mode
- Fight the system when it says defensive

## Example

**Today's Mode: 🟠 ORANGE (10% cap, 40% max invested, 25% trim cap)**

You have a $100,000 portfolio with $60,000 cash.

- **Daily cap:** $60,000 × 10% = $6,000 max deployment today
- **Max invested:** $100,000 × 40% = $40,000 max in TSLA
- **Current position:** $30,000 in TSLA
- **Room to add:** $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000 total (but only $6,000 today)
- **Trim cap:** If TSLA hits T1, trim 25% of $30,000 = $7,500

## Key Takeaway

The mode isn't a suggestion — it's a **risk management rule**. GREEN doesn't mean "buy everything." RED doesn't mean "don't trade." It means **size accordingly** and respect the limits.

*Your mode is set every morning in the Daily Report. Check it first.*
