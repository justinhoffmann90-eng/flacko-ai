## What a mode means

A mode is the system’s risk dial. It tells you **how aggressive or defensive to be** based on current market conditions. When the mode changes, your **position sizing and expectations** change with it.

## How modes are determined

Modes are derived from the same inputs you see in the daily report:

- **Gamma environment** (supportive vs. hostile)
- **Flow and positioning** (are dealers supporting or resisting trend?)
- **Technical posture** (trend, momentum, and key levels)
- **Volatility regime** (calm vs. unstable)

The goal is simple: **stay aggressive when conditions are favorable, reduce risk when they aren’t.**

## How to use modes in real time

- **Size first.** Your daily cap is the top of the range. Don’t exceed it.
- **Quality matters.** Lower modes demand higher conviction and cleaner setups.
- **Re-evaluate after alerts.** Mode + alert = context for action.

## Examples

- **Green mode with a bullish alert**: you can scale into a position and hold through minor noise.
- **Orange mode with a bearish alert**: focus on quick, high-probability moves only.
- **Red mode**: capital preservation is the priority — trade small or stand aside.
