## What a mode means

A mode is the system's risk dial. It tells you **how aggressive or defensive to be** based on current market conditions. When the mode changes, your **position sizing and expectations** change with it.

## The four modes

| Mode | Daily Cap | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Up to 25% | Conditions favorable. Full offense available. |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | 15% or less | Proceed with caution. Be selective. |
| 🟠 **Orange** | 10% or less | Elevated risk. Small positions only. |
| 🔴 **Red** | 5% or less | Defensive mode. Protect capital. |

The **daily cap** is your maximum position size for new entries. Not a target — a ceiling.

## How modes are determined

Modes are derived from multiple inputs:

- **Gamma environment** — Positive (supportive) vs negative (hostile)
- **Dealer flow** — Are institutions accumulating or distributing?
- **Technical posture** — Trend, momentum, key level positions
- **Volatility regime** — Calm vs unstable conditions

The goal is simple: **stay aggressive when conditions favor you, reduce risk when they don't.**

## How to use modes in real time

**1. Size first.** Check the mode before planning any trade. Your daily cap is the ceiling.

**2. Quality over quantity.** Lower modes demand higher conviction setups. Don't force trades.

**3. Combine with levels.** Mode tells you *how much*. Levels tell you *where*. Use both.

**4. Re-evaluate after alerts.** When a key level is hit, reassess. Mode + alert = context for action.

## Examples

- **Green mode + bullish alert**: Scale in confidently. Hold through minor noise.
- **Orange mode + bearish alert**: Quick, high-probability moves only. Tight stops.
- **Red mode**: Capital preservation is the priority. Trade small or stand aside.

## Why this works

Most traders size based on confidence — which is just another word for feelings.

Modes size based on *conditions*. The market doesn't care how confident you are. It cares about structure, flow, and volatility.

When you match your risk to the environment, you stop getting chopped up in hostile conditions and maximize gains when conditions favor you.
