## What Is the Gamma Strike?

The **Gamma Strike** is the price level with the highest gamma exposure. It's where dealer hedging activity is most intense — making it the most reactive zone on the chart.

## Why It Matters

| **Above Gamma Strike** | Buy dips, sell rips | Calm, mean-reverting |
| **Below Gamma Strike** | Sell dips, buy rips | Volatile, trending |

## The Flip Effect

When price crosses the Gamma Strike, everything changes:

| Regime | Price Action | Strategy |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Positive Gamma** | Chop, ranges, fades | Fade extremes |
