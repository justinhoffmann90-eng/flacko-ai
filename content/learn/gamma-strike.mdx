## What is the Gamma Strike?

The **Gamma Strike** (also called Gamma Flip or Vol Trigger) is the price level with the highest gamma exposure. It's the most reactive zone on the chart — small moves here cause big dealer adjustments.

## Why It Matters

Gamma measures how fast dealers need to adjust their hedges. At the Gamma Strike:
- **Above it**: Positive gamma — dealers buy dips, sell rips (stabilizing)
- **Below it**: Negative gamma — dealers sell dips, buy rips (amplifying)

## The Flip Effect

When price crosses the Gamma Strike, market behavior changes:

| Position | Dealer Behavior | Market Feel |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Above Gamma Strike | Buy weakness, sell strength | Calm, mean-reverting |
| Below Gamma Strike | Sell weakness, buy strength | Volatile, trending |

## How to Use It

1. **Regime indicator**: Know if you're in positive or negative gamma
2. **Key level**: Price often reacts strongly at the Gamma Strike
3. **Trade style**: Above = fade moves. Below = ride momentum.

## In the Daily Report

The Gamma Strike is highlighted in **Key Levels**. Always know where you are relative to it.
