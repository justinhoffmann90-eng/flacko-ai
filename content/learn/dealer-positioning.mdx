## What Is Dealer Positioning?

**Dealer positioning** shows where market makers are hedged and how they'll react to price moves. It's the foundation of gamma-based trading.

---

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Dealers** | Market makers who sell you options |
| **Hedging** | How dealers offset their risk |
| **Gamma exposure** | How much dealers must buy/sell when price moves |
| **Open interest** | Total outstanding contracts at each strike |

---

## How Dealers Hedge

| Customer Buys | Dealer Does | Price Effect |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Calls | Buys shares | Pushes up |
| Puts | Sells shares | Pushes down |
| Call spreads | Partial hedge | Muted effect |
| Put spreads | Partial hedge | Muted effect |

## Reading the Options Chain

| Strike | Call OI | Put OI | Dominant | Implication |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| $430 | 50,000 | 10,000 | Calls | Call Wall — resistance |
| $420 | 30,000 | 35,000 | Balanced | Gamma Strike — reaction zone |
| $410 | 15,000 | 45,000 | Puts | Put Wall — support |

---

## Positioning Signals

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Heavy call OI above price** | Upside magnet, resistance |
| **Heavy put OI below price** | Downside floor, support |
| **Call OI increasing** | Market expects upside |
| **Put OI increasing** | Market hedging downside |
| **OI concentrated at one strike** | Strong pin potential |

---

## Dealer Gamma Profile

The **gamma profile** shows net dealer exposure across strikes:

```
Positive Gamma Zone (above $420)
─────────────────────────────────
     │ Dealers buy dips
     │ Dealers sell rips
     │ = Stabilizing
─────────────────────────────────
Gamma Strike ($420)
─────────────────────────────────
     │ Dealers sell dips
     │ Dealers buy rips
     │ = Amplifying
─────────────────────────────────
Negative Gamma Zone (below $420)
```

## How Positioning Changes

| Event | Effect on Positioning |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Options expiration** | OI drops, levels reset |
| **Big price move** | Dealers adjust, levels shift |
| **New week** | Fresh flow, updated strikes |
| **Earnings approach** | Put OI increases (hedging) |

---

## Using Positioning in Your Trading

| Positioning | Trading Approach |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Strong Call Wall above** | Expect resistance, take profits near |
| **Strong Put Wall below** | Expect support, look for bounces |
| **Gamma Strike nearby** | Watch for reaction, high volatility |
| **Imbalanced OI** | Follow the dominant direction |

---

## Example

> **SpotGamma Data:**
> - Call Wall: $435 (heavy OI)
> - Gamma Strike: $420
> - Put Wall: $400 (heavy OI)
> - Current price: $418
> 
> **Read:**
> - Just below Gamma Strike = negative gamma territory
> - Put Wall provides support at $400
> - Call Wall caps upside at $435
> 
> **Implication:**
> - Expect volatility (negative gamma)
> - Look for bounce at $400
> - Fade rallies toward $435

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| **Dealers hedge** | Their actions move price |
| **OI shows positioning** | High OI = key level |
| **Gamma profile matters** | Above vs below strike changes behavior |
| **Positioning shifts** | Check daily, especially after OpEx |
