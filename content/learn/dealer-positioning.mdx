## The players you're trading against

When you buy TSLA options, someone has to take the other side. That someone is usually a market maker — a large institution that provides liquidity and hedges their exposure in real-time.

These dealers don't have opinions about where TSLA is going. They're not bullish or bearish. They're *neutral* — but their hedging activity moves markets.

## How dealer hedging works

Let's say a trader buys $400 TSLA calls. The dealer who sold those calls now has risk: if TSLA goes up, they lose money.

To stay neutral, the dealer buys TSLA stock to hedge. If TSLA keeps going up, they buy more. If it goes down, they sell.

Multiply this by billions of dollars in options flow, and you get *massive* buying and selling pressure at specific price levels.

## Supportive vs hostile regimes

**Positive gamma (supportive)**
- Dealers buy dips and sell rips
- Price moves get absorbed
- Trends are smoother, less volatile
- Easier to hold positions

**Negative gamma (hostile)**
- Dealers sell into weakness, buy into strength
- Moves accelerate and overshoot
- Volatility spikes
- Harder to time entries and exits

Same stock. Same news. Completely different trading environments.

## The levels dealers defend

Dealer positioning clusters around option strikes with high open interest:

- **Put Wall**: Heavy put concentration. Dealers buy stock here to hedge. Acts as support.
- **Call Wall**: Heavy call concentration. Dealers sell stock here. Acts as resistance.
- **Gamma Strike**: The flip zone. Above it, dealers are supportive. Below it, they're hostile.

These levels shift as options expire and new positions are opened. What was support yesterday might be gone tomorrow.

## Reading the flow

Beyond static levels, there's real-time flow. When institutions aggressively buy puts, dealers have to sell stock. When call buying spikes, dealers hedge by buying.

This is why TSLA can move 3% in minutes on no news — the flow changed, dealers adjusted, and price followed.

## Why this matters for you

You don't need to trade options to benefit from this. Understanding dealer positioning tells you:

- Where support and resistance actually live (not just trendlines)
- Whether the environment favors holding or scalping
- When a move is likely to accelerate vs. reverse

It's the difference between trading with the structure and fighting against it.
