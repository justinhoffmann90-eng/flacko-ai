## Why levels matter

Levels are where the market tends to **accelerate, stall, or reverse**. Flacko AI highlights the most important levels so you can plan **before** price gets there.

## Core levels

### Call Wall
The largest concentration of call exposure. Price often **gravitates** toward it and can **stall** or **pin** around this level.

### Put Wall
The largest concentration of put exposure. When price approaches, it often **slows** or **bounces** as hedging flows increase.

### Gamma Strike
The inflection point where dealer positioning shifts. Above gamma strike, the market tends to be **more stable**. Below it, movement can become **faster and more volatile**.

### Hedge Wall
A level where dealer hedging pressure can **flip direction** and accelerate moves. It often acts like a magnet before a breakout.

## Supporting levels

- **Pause Zone** — a price area where momentum frequently fades; use it to manage expectations.
- **Master Eject** — the line in the sand. If price breaks here, the system flips defensive fast.
- **Weekly 9 EMA** — the trend filter; a break changes the regime.

## How to use levels

1. **Plan your reaction in advance.** Know what you’ll do if price reaches each level.
2. **Don’t front‑run.** Let price confirm the level before acting.
3. **Use levels as decision points.** Size up or down based on how price behaves at the level.

Levels are not targets — they’re **decision zones**. The job is to react with discipline, not prediction.
