## Why levels matter

Every trader draws lines on charts. Support. Resistance. Trendlines.

But most of those lines are arbitrary. They're based on past price action and hope.

**Key levels** are different. They're based on *where dealers have to act* — creating real, mechanical support and resistance that holds because institutions are forced to defend them.

## The levels we track

### Gamma Strike
The pivot point where dealer behavior flips. Above it, dealers are supportive (buying dips). Below it, they're hostile (selling into weakness). This is often the most important level of the day.

### Put Wall
Where heavy put open interest creates a floor. Dealers who sold these puts must buy stock to hedge as price approaches. This creates buying pressure and support.

### Call Wall  
Where heavy call open interest creates a ceiling. Dealers who sold calls must sell stock to hedge. This creates selling pressure and resistance.

### Hedge Wall
The price with maximum dealer hedging activity. Can act as either support or resistance depending on approach direction.

## How levels behave

**Support levels** (Put Wall, Gamma Strike from below):
- Price tends to bounce here
- Breaks often accelerate into the next level
- Best entries are tests that hold

**Resistance levels** (Call Wall, Gamma Strike from above):
- Price tends to stall here
- Breaks above can trigger squeezes
- Best exits are tests that fail

## Levels shift daily

Unlike trendlines you drew six months ago, these levels **change with options flow**. What was support yesterday might be gone today as options expire and new positions are opened.

This is why static analysis fails. The terrain is always shifting.

## Using levels in your trading

**1. Know the levels before the open.** Flacko AI publishes them every morning.

**2. Watch for tests.** When price approaches a level, pay attention. This is where action happens.

**3. React to holds or breaks.** A hold confirms the level. A break means the next level becomes the target.

**4. Combine with mode.** In green mode, you can trade level bounces aggressively. In red mode, respect them from distance.
