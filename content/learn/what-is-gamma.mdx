## The force you can't see

Every time TSLA rips 8% or dumps 6% in a single day, people scramble for explanations. Elon tweeted. Macro shifted. Analysts upgraded.

But there's something else moving price that most traders never see: **gamma exposure**.

## What gamma actually is

Gamma is a measure of how much market makers (the big institutions that provide liquidity) need to buy or sell stock to hedge their options positions.

Here's the simple version:

- **Positive gamma**: Dealers buy when price rises, sell when it falls. This *dampens* moves and creates stability.
- **Negative gamma**: Dealers sell when price falls, buy when it rises. This *amplifies* moves and creates chaos.

When TSLA is in positive gamma territory, moves tend to be smoother. When it's in negative gamma, volatility explodes.

## Why TSLA is different

Tesla has the most active options market of any single stock. Billions of dollars in options flow every week. This makes gamma effects *massive* compared to other stocks.

That 5% intraday swing? It wasn't just news. It was dealers forced to hedge, amplifying the move in real-time.

## The levels that matter

Gamma exposure isn't uniform across all prices. It clusters around specific strike prices — creating invisible walls and magnets:

- **Gamma Strike**: The price where gamma flips from positive to negative. A critical pivot.
- **Put Wall**: Heavy put open interest creates downside support — dealers buy here.
- **Call Wall**: Heavy call open interest creates upside resistance — dealers sell here.
- **Hedge Wall**: Where dealers have the most hedging to do.

These aren't arbitrary lines. They're structural features of the market that repeat day after day.

## What most traders miss

Most traders look at charts and draw trendlines. They watch moving averages. They read news.

What they miss: the structural landscape created by options positioning. Price doesn't move randomly — it moves *through* a terrain shaped by dealer hedging flows.

When you know the terrain, you stop being surprised.
