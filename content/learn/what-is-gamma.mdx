## The Simple Version

**Gamma** measures how fast options dealers need to adjust their hedges when price moves.

Think of it like a rubber band:
- **High gamma** = tight rubber band (small moves cause big reactions)
- **Low gamma** = loose rubber band (price moves freely)

## Why Dealers Hedge

When you buy an option, a market maker sells it to you. They don't want the risk, so they **hedge**.

| You Buy | Dealer Does | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Calls | Buys shares | Pushes price up |
| Puts | Sells shares | Pushes price down |

This hedging creates **predictable behavior** at certain price levels.

## Positive vs Negative Gamma

| Regime | Dealer Behavior | Market Feel |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Positive Gamma** | Buy dips, sell rips | Calm, mean-reverting |
| **Negative Gamma** | Sell dips, buy rips | Volatile, trending |

### Positive Gamma (Above Gamma Strike)
```
Price drops → Dealers buy → Stabilizes price
Price rises → Dealers sell → Caps the move
```
**Result:** Choppy, range-bound action

### Negative Gamma (Below Gamma Strike)
```
Price drops → Dealers sell → Accelerates drop
Price rises → Dealers buy → Accelerates rise
```
**Result:** Trending, volatile moves

---

## The Gamma Flip

The **Gamma Strike** (or Vol Trigger) is where gamma flips from positive to negative.

| Position | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Above Gamma Strike** | Dealers stabilize moves |
| **Below Gamma Strike** | Dealers amplify moves |

This is why the Gamma Strike is the most important level to know.

## Visual Example

```
$450 ────────── Call Wall (upside magnet)
       │
$430 ────────── Gamma Strike (regime flip)
       │
       │  ← POSITIVE GAMMA (calm)
       │
$420 ──┼────────────────────────────
       │
       │  ← NEGATIVE GAMMA (volatile)
       │
$400 ────────── Put Wall (downside floor)
```

## Key Takeaways

| Concept | Remember |
|---------|----------|
| **Gamma** | How fast dealers hedge |
| **Positive gamma** | Dealers fight the move (stable) |
| **Negative gamma** | Dealers fuel the move (volatile) |
| **Gamma Strike** | Where behavior flips |

## How to Use This

1. **Know where Gamma Strike is** — Check the daily report
2. **Trade the regime** — Fade moves in positive gamma, ride trends in negative gamma
3. **Expect volatility below** — Size smaller when in negative gamma
