## Why we track accuracy

Anyone can make predictions. The question is: **do they work?**

The weekly review answers that question with data. Every level, every scenario, every call — tracked and graded.

## What gets tracked

### Level Performance
Every key level from every daily report:
- Did the Put Wall hold as support?
- Did the Call Wall act as resistance?
- Was the Gamma Strike pivot respected?

Levels are graded: ✅ Held | ❌ Broke | ⏸️ Not Tested

### Scenario Accuracy
Each day has Bull/Base/Bear scenarios. We track:
- Which scenario triggered?
- Did the expected target get hit?
- Was the action guidance correct?

### Mode Appropriateness  
Looking back at the week:
- Were green modes actually good for offense?
- Did red modes correctly identify danger?
- Would different sizing have helped or hurt?

## Learning from accuracy data

The weekly review isn't just a report card. It's a learning tool.

**Patterns emerge over time:**
- Which levels are most reliable?
- When do scenarios tend to miss?
- What market conditions make predictions harder?

**Adjustments follow:**
- Weight reliable levels more heavily
- Size down when conditions are historically tricky
- Trust the process when it's been working

## Accountability builds trust

Most trading services don't track accuracy. They make calls, and if they're wrong, they move on. No record. No accountability.

Flacko AI tracks everything because **the data either backs up the system or it doesn't**. If accuracy drops, you'll see it. If the system is working, the numbers prove it.

Transparency isn't a feature. It's the baseline.

  <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
    <div className="text-2xl">📊</div>
    <div>
      <div className="font-bold text-green-400">Running Accuracy: 83%</div>
      <div className="text-sm text-zinc-300">Levels held or broke as expected across the last 30 days.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Using reviews to improve

Each weekly review includes a "Lessons" section. Read it. The patterns matter:

- "Put Wall was tested 3x this week and held each time" → Trust it more next week
- "HIRO divergence preceded both major reversals" → Watch HIRO more closely
- "Orange mode days had 2 false breakouts" → Size even smaller in Orange

The system improves. So should your use of it.
