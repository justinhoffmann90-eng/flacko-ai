## The goal of the report

The daily report is your **one‑page operating system**: it sets the mode, highlights key levels, and defines the scenarios for the day.

## Key sections

### 1) Mode + posture
This is your **risk framework** for the day. Mode controls sizing; posture explains whether we’re leaning bullish, bearish, or neutral.

### 2) Key levels table
The levels section is the **map**. It shows Call Wall, Put Wall, Gamma Strike, Hedge Wall, and other action points.

### 3) What to do (action plan)
This is the **playbook** — specific reactions at each level.

### 4) Scenarios (Bull / Base / Bear)
The scenarios define **probabilities** and expected market paths. They help you choose which setups deserve size.

### 5) Alerts
The alert table tells you **what will trigger** and why it matters.

## Best practices

- Read the **mode first** — it governs everything else.
- Use **levels as decision points**, not predictions.
- Align your trades to the **highest‑probability scenario**.

If you can only scan one thing, scan **mode + key levels**. That gives you 80% of the edge.
