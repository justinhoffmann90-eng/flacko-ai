## The Daily Report Framework (v4.2)

The report is built for speed: **Page 1 should be scannable in ~60 seconds**, then Page 2 provides full detail.

---

## Page 1: Fast Decision Layer

### 1) Mode + Rationale
Start with mode and the short reason behind it.

| Simplified Mode Cap View | Daily Cap |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| 🟢 GREEN | 25% |
| 🟡 YELLOW | 15% |
| 🟠 ORANGE | 10% |
| 🔴 RED | 5% |

### 2) Positioning Table
A concise 4-row table that summarizes:

| Field | What You Get |
|------|---------------|
| Mode | Current risk color/state |
| Daily Cap | How much of available cash can be deployed |
| Trim Cap | How aggressively to reduce into resistance |
| Lean + Key Watch | Directional posture + the one level/signal that matters most |

### 3) Indicator Dashboard
A **single consolidated dashboard table** replaces the old multi-tier indicator layout.

### 4) Alert Levels + Actions
Levels are listed with short, executable actions.

### 5) Why These Levels
A structural explanation (gamma positioning, EMA structure, dealer flow context) for why levels matter.

### 6) Scenarios
Three scenario paths with probabilities:

| Scenario | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Bull | Upside continuation/breakout path |
| Base | Most likely path / chop-to-trend baseline |
| Bear | Breakdown or failed-bounce path |

### 7) Flacko AI's Take
A **story-first read** of the day (not just indicator repetition).

### 8) Call Options Status
A quick state read for options: ACTIVE / WATCHING / AVOID (and NO_SIGNAL when applicable).

## Page 2: Deep Detail Layer

Page 2 carries the full technical and flow context:

- SpotGamma data
- Detailed technical analysis
- Full call options analysis

Use this for deeper trade planning, not quick open prep.

---

## How to Read It in Order

1. **Mode + Positioning table** (risk and sizing first)
2. **Alert Levels + Why These Levels** (execution map)
3. **Scenarios + Flacko AI's Take** (context and path probabilities)
4. **Call Options status** (separate options signal layer)
5. **Page 2 detail** only if you need deeper confirmation

## What Changed from Older Reports

| Old Structure | New v4.2 Structure |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Separate tiered indicator blocks | Single Indicator Dashboard |
| Action Plan section | Alert Levels + Why These Levels |
| Less explicit options status | Dedicated call options status on Page 1 |
| More fragmented scan flow | 60-second scannable Page 1 |

---

## Key Takeaway

Read Page 1 for execution, Page 2 for depth.  
If you only have one minute, focus on:
1. Mode
2. Positioning table
3. Alert levels
4. Scenario probabilities
5. Call options status
