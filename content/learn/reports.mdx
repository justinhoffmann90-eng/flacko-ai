## Your daily trading briefing

Every market day, Flacko AI publishes a comprehensive report before the open. One document with everything you need to trade TSLA with structure.

No noise. No fluff. Just the intel that matters.

## What's in the report

### Mode & Daily Cap
The risk regime for the day. Green, yellow, orange, or red — plus your position size ceiling. This sets the tone for everything else.

### Key Levels
The exact prices where structure lives:
- Gamma Strike (the pivot)
- Put Wall (downside support)
- Call Wall (upside resistance)  
- Hedge Wall (maximum dealer activity)

### HIRO Reading
Real-time dealer positioning flow. Are institutions accumulating or distributing? This tells you who's on which side.

### Scenarios
Bull, base, and bear paths — with triggers, targets, and action steps for each.

### Alert Levels
The specific prices that will trigger notifications. You'll know in advance what levels we're watching.
